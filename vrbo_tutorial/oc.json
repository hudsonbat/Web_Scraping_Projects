The neighborhood was quiet and well-maintained. The property manager was very timely and thorough with her communications. We had absolutely no issues with any part of our stay from check in to check out. Everything in the property worked as we expected it to and the kitchen was fully stocked with all of the stuff (utensils, pots, pans, plates, cutlery, etc) we needed to prepare our traditional Sunday breakfast.

The owners were very responsive and helpful to any questions we had. Perfect escape and we look forward to a repeat soon!", "The property is in a great location. Quiet neighborhood with water views, and just a 20-minute drive to all the hustle and bustle of the inlet. The house is bright, cheerful, and comfortable. We were also appreciative of being able to rent a house where we could bring our dog. Rebecca was a wonderful host, and communication was great.

There were 8 females in our group, and 2 rolls of TP didn't cut it for 4 nights. Also, while there is a vacuum, there is no broom and dust pan. Being at the beach, you are gonna have sand everywhere.

I have never stayed in something so small and not clean for something this expensive. Pictures were deceiving. Another thing I didn't like was the only spot for my baby's pack n play was near the closet in one bed bedroom. When you open doors you can see air filter is completely full, dirty and gross. At the end of our trip my baby was wheezing and sick with a cold. The place did its job as we went there to go to the beach but definitely could have been cleaner.

The couch had trash under it so you could tell no one had cleaned. Let\u2019s talk about the communication with the property manager. After I submitted my complaint of the hygiene in the place, no one ever came to talk to me or try to make up for it. Not sure how the listing says covid cleaning when it is no where close to that.", "Amenities were upgraded from our last visit. The location is noisy.", "Clean, comfortable and convenient. We will definitely book again. The on site pool and security was a plus. We were in walking distance from the excitement and the environment was very clean and noise appropriate.", "Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this property. It was not clean at all. I was terrified to sit on the furniture so I ended up covering the couch and beds with my own sheets. Random chairs (that looked like they were literally pulled out from a dumpster) were so incredibly stained and disgusting. Shower was not cleaned and did not drain properly so when you took a shower you were standing in about half an inch of water. What was most appalling was the fact that the comforter on one of the beds had stains and crusted dry food or something, but what made this more concerning was the fact that someone\u2019s review in April complained of the exact same thing. This unfortunately tells me that the blankets on the bed are NEVER washed. What made it worse was it seemed that the person \u201ccleaning\u201d flipped the stained side over so guests wouldn\u2019t notice?? \nAll bedsheets looked like they had been ironed on the bed rather than washed, hairs, lint, crumbs, etc all over. The towels had several hairs in them. \nIn addition, though I know the owners don\u2019t have control over what occurs outside the building, just a warning, if you want to actually sleep at night, don\u2019t book this room. There were people in the parking lot next door partying and playing loud music all night long. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re into and you don\u2019t mind filth, then this place is for you.\nI rarely ever leave bad comments/reviews but I felt I needed to for this property. People rely heavily on reviews when booking and this was really disappointing. What bothers me most is that in a time like this (Covid) you would think that the owners/property company would ensure cleanliness was a top priority for guests. I will not be booking anything through Vacasa again and I\u2019ll be sure to warn others.", "Clean and nice in cozy even tho the pool wasn\u2019t open", "This was the first time I booked through Vrbo. I am not sure who is actually responsible for contacting customers. Is it the owner? Vacasa? Jocelyn Manor? or someone at Vrbo? I reached out with questions upon my initial booking 2 weeks prior to my stay and my questions were not addressed. I received a generic email and text just prior to my stay with incorrect check in information. There is no office to check in with. There is no one at the property to answer questions. \nNo one to get a parking pass from. This made me a neurotic mess because there are warnings about your car being towed EVERYWHERE and the email and text received said I could get a pass from the office. However, upon arrival... there is No office. There was no one available via email. Nor phone. I was able to leave a message through the answering service.... but when I received a call back 1030 AM the following day the person was not familiar with the area. They told me to get in contact with the owner. Extremely frustrating.\nAnother note about poor communication - I received information that if I wanted to avoid going to the grocery store, there was the option to have your groceries delivered to the property. They would be delivered and kept at the office. I almost took full advantage of this because I thought it was a great idea. Again - no office. I have no idea where my groceries would have ended up?! oi vey. \n\nThis unit was also dirty. Furniture throughout the building was dirty and stained. The linens had caked/crusty food on them.\n\nVery very disappointing. I stayed only because 1. I brought my own bedding and extra linings and was able to drape them over the furniture. \n\nThe back had what seemed like a nice patch of green but there was trash in the back. \n\nI am writing this review because I feel I should be credited back 50% of my total if not a full refund. It is in poor taste to state this in a review but I cannot reach anyone and this is my only means of communication. \n\nAlso, just on a personal note, I would never stay at this place again because of the neighbor. He was constantly walking in front of my unit and hanging out, which was weird since I was at the end in the corner. Just made me feel very unsafe. I know it was beyond anyone's control but to make matters worse the building was being worked on and updated too. So much for having a peaceful breakfast after not being able to sleep as I kept thinking the tow truck was going to tow my car away. \nugh."], "ratings": [4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 2, 5, 1], "availability": "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYYYYYYYNNNY"},

The location was wonderful, right on the ocean and they give you a parking pass and that was very convenient too. The room wasn\u2019t ready for check in (3pm) so we went to eat while we waited. The front desk lady was very sweet and kind. Our room wasn\u2019t clean when we got in there. We know it\u2019s a condo and not a hotel and grew up in ocean city every single summer, we know what to expect and we\u2019re really not unrealistic people at all\u2026 but there was used dental floss in the living area, food behind the couch pillows, dirt and sand everywhere, and the shower curtain had red mold all over it. I would also recommend to stay on the top floor if you have small kids because we were on the third floor and the floors aren\u2019t carpeted so we heard everything above us and the people above us were up all night and screaming and stomping. We left one night early to get some sleep. The indoor pool was nice and the building was secure, I do feel it was overpriced for the noise and the cleanliness issue, I also take issue with the fact that part of our stay includes a cleaning fee we pay for the room to be cleaned after us for the next guest, but our room wasn\u2019t clean.

They slept in the beds and I slept on the couch (which is comfy, in good condition, and very spacious - a set of sheets were available for me to put over the cushions at night.).\n\nMany pros. Very close to beach, and good ocean view from the balcony. Cute decor. The kitchen is great: clean coffee machine, refrigerator, and dishwasher helped us through the half-week. TV and basic cable helps: I got to watch some of the NBA Conference Championships and cable news in the morning. The kids and I played air hockey and foozball in the game room when it rained. There is a laundry room on the Second Floor with free detergent - they worked great. This is an undersold perk of the rental, IMHO. Front desk and building staff were SUPER nice to us.\n\nA few cons: the building is showing some signs of age, and an air-conditioned lobby might be nice. Some of the VRBO instructions, handouts, and front-desk instructions conflicted on things like check-out and air conditioning. Our unit also didn't have tissues or dish towels. Unit was very clean. The only really bad thing was a very mildewy shower curtain (which I reported to owners - but still, yuck!).\n\nBut for a short stay, this was wonderful.

Regardless of if someone can come fix it, this is our time and space for three days, we don\u2019t need maintenance men in here or fielding calls to work out a time. We paid for the space, we expect it to be right. Cherry on top was that the listing stated the parking spot was in the garage, when it\u2019s very much so not.

Additionally there are signs everywhere about trash but no directions on where it goes. Yet another wild goose chase. The trash is all picked up in bags by the door.

My BF who is a strong construction worker in NYC (steamfitter) had to use all his strength to slide the door open. Screen was completely ripped on the screen door so we could not even leave it open if we wanted to. When we called Vacaca, they were trying to get someone to fix the door, no one ever did. \nOperating the TV's and the range top was challenging and the kitchen truly lacked proper cooking utensils (I LOVE to cook breakfast when on vacation).\nI was more than willing to pay for the stay but we didn't get what was advertised. \nI had a beautiful time in the area, and I hate to complain, but think it's wise to share this experience so the management company or the owner takes some ownership for this. \nVacaca did give us a $200 credit (I had to negotiate this) which I feel was not enough for what we paid but I was just too angry to let this ruin my vacation.
