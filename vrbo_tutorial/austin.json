Also, the hot water was testy. Sometimes it was working, sometimes it took a long time to get going. The day bed was stellar.\n\nSo now, the worst part. It didn\u2019t take us more than an hour to determine that the neighbors we shared a wall with were running a vigorous brothel business, which led them to run out in front of our unit, screaming and counting cash every 20 minutes throughout the entirety of our stay. It was impossible to sleep through the night without the various pimps screaming directly into our windows. There were also times that patrons of the brothel would mistake our unit for the brothel and attempt to enter. Thank god Shelli had good locks on the doors. \n\nWe shared all this with Shelli and she was immediately on it. There seems to be a path to resolution to remove this activity from the property.

The air conditioner was not cooling the bedroom and when we checked the filter it was solidly packed with dust. There were dead and dying plants hanging on either side of the bed, with long dead vines hanging down to the nightstands, making me wonder what might descend on me while I slept. We took those plants and others that covered a shelving unit outside. The hosts own toiletries were in large baskets on the bathroom shelves and in the vanity drawers, making it difficult to find room for our own belongings. We spent eight man hours cleaning the place to make it habitable. When I informed the host, he said thank you, but did not offer to compensate for our time in any way.

Early morning runs through the neighborhood were awesome. Information available from owner the best I've ever seen. No question left unanswered, from type of coffee maker to excellent check in and check out instructions. Bed is great, kitchen awesome and the patio delightful. Whole place the size of a large hotel room, but so much better with the kitchen and patio and laundry room next door. Furnishings are perfect for the space - good size bed, large desk, comfy couch, table for dining. Bathroom is huge with great counter space and storage. Shower door is VERY small (turn sideways to get in) but the shower is fine once inside. You do hear the upstairs residents move around. But we seemed to be on the same early to bed, early to rise schedule so we really didn't notice. The weather was beautiful while we were there, which created our only disappointment: the only windows with screens were small, high and a little awkward to open. Would have been so awesome to open up for fresh air and spring breezes, but no screens on doors or bathroom window - so when open we got bees and flies and typical spring critters. However, we had cool mornings we ran the heat and one afternoon it was hot enough to need the A/C, both worked beautifully and fast. So for typical Austin warm weather, I suppose that is more important. If you have allergies and like to be closed up with great HVAC - it's perfect. Hope we get a chance to stay here again. Best location ever, easiest in and out, immediate response to our few questions and accommodated our late check out. Ann is a great hostess.", "Loved the little studio. Private, quiet, comfortable.

I was here for five nights in mid-February while doing research at the University's Harry Ransom Center. The studio was absolutely ideal--it could not have been better! Although it is only one room, the size and arrangement of the furniture makes it feel very spacious. The kitchen is well-equipped with essential pots, pans, and so on; the bathroom is sizable; and the bed and couch are comfortable. I was staying by myself but would not hesitate to stay here again with my partner.\n\nThe best part of the studio, though, is that the property and location are charming and peaceful. The deck is even lovelier than the pictures indicate--you really feel like you are up in the trees! The perfect spot for morning coffee, especially when the mockingbirds start singing. The apartment was *very* quiet--I was worried that I'd be able to hear the neighbors in the main house or downstairs, but I couldn't at all (and I'm very sensitive to noise, so this means it really was quiet). \n\nThe neighborhood was great--lots of good places to run, a great yoga studio (Black Lagoon Art + Yoga, up on Guadalupe), and the terrific Wheatsville coop. About a mile to the University, an easy and pretty walk. \n\nHighly recommended!", "The room was clean and well-equipped in terms of a very comfortable bathroom and shower, nice little kitchen, good T.V. My one complaint is that there were no good reading lights. The light over the bed was not bad but not good, - but the lamp next to the couch/loveseat was too dim and not a good height for reading. The neighborhood is quiet with easy access to a bus line and a short 8 minute walk to a nice little grocery and restaurants. The information booklet about the place was missing, but I was able to get information from my brother who stayed in the downstairs unit. Had he not been downstairs, I would have been at a loss.

Before arriving I was told that I could use a storage unit in the back of the house for my luggage if I arrived early. We had the early flight arriving at 10 am so we decided we were going to put our belongings in the storage unit, lock it, go to lunch and then tour the city, go to the parks and lake. When I arrived the driveway and backyard were very muddy and had several large puddles of standing water making it very difficult to get to the shed which was full of construction supplies. The standing water created an infestation of mosquitos and tapeworms. In addition to the standing water there was construction debris and garbage piled up in the backyard. Broken glass, drywall, flooring, trim pieces, old windows and blinds are just a few of the items strewn between the front/back yard and front porch. In the pictures there's a patio with pergola and market street lights, which I imagined myself relaxing on with a bottle of wine, this patio was covered in garbage, cigarette butts and some sort of pipe. I wanted to call a cab and leave and I had not even entered the unit yet!! I did make room for my luggage in the shed, I only felt safe leaving my clothing and not my valuables inside the shed. Leaving me carrying a large heavy bag everywhere I went.  My guest and I decided to walk to the nearest restaurant for lunch. We then walked to the Whole Foods Market and sat on the patio until that afternoon. I did not get to go to the lake or the park that day. I messaged the owner to please respond and let me know when the unit would be ready to enter (I never heard back or from the owner the entire trip!) We finally walked back to the house and see if it was ready for check in. This time when I arrived there was a construction truck in the driveway with several construction men working in the back yard and on one of the units of the house. Our door code worked and we went inside, the front door had a large mud puddle creating a mess inside since there was no door mat to wipe our feet. Thankfully the bed was comfy and there was hot water. There was only 2 small towels for the two of us girls to use. We tried to take a nap but couldn't due to the loud sounds of the construction in the unit beside us. The neighborhood/street is run down with broken down cars, dilapidated houses and over grown yards. "], "ratings": [5, 1, 5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 4, 1], "availability": "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYY"},

The only problem I had was in the morning there was construction right out. I\u2019m a heavy sleeper so it didn\u2019t bother me and plus it\u2019s a weekday so what do you expect. But still a really convenient location for all the bars! I loved it. Super clean and really cute and stylish", "I would absolutely never stay at this property again or work with the owner again. His partners were actually very nice and helpful - Maria and Angel, but Edwin was very unkind and poor customer service, very difficult to work with. \n\nThis property is not in a good area of town. Next to the townhome is an empty unkept lot with weeds and a dumpster. There is also a huge homeless problem in the neighborhood with multiple tents lining the streets. There is nothing walkable about this location either. You are separated from downtown by a major freeway. \n\nUpon check in, our code did not work for the doors and we had trouble getting in touch with the property owners, so we sat outside in the hot sun waiting for them to send us the correct code. When we entered the townhome, it appeared somewhat clean, but rundown. There was a refrigerator with tons of condiments that is really in poor taste to leave especially during COVID. \n\nThe worse part of our stay was we had an intruder enter the home at 2am using a code the property owners had given out. Luckily, no one in our group was harmed, but it was extremely scary. We were a group of women staying there and could not sleep the rest of the night out of fear. When I told Maria and Angel about the incident the next morning, they were both so kind and willing to give a refund. I could tell they felt horrible this happened. Several days later I received a refund email, but it was not for the amount agreed upon. Edwin would not return my emails or phone calls. I finally got in touch with him and he was extremely rude, inconsiderate about what had happened and unwilling to refund the original amount paid. I contacted VRBO and they were willing to work with me and helpful to make sure I was refunded entirely. \n\nI can't believe this happened to us. When I arrived at the property, I sent a message to Edwin stating that I did not feel the property was safe and then my suspicions were confirmed when we had a 2am intruder. Very scary. Edwin said I should have known the area and he didn't know he was renting to a group of women. Hmmm... maybe his listing should state, property may not be safe?", "This home had some unique modern twists, but note that it is a shared courtyard space with the backyard apartment. Not modern, was the back yard Weber charcoal grill, which I still love, but no available charcoal, so be prepared to find your own. Also \u201cquiet hours\u201d start at 9PM. Target and Whole Foods, are not literally across the street, nor would I feel comfortable walking the 3 blocks and across the railroad tracks. \nOwner was very responsive to our needs when the air conditioning wasn\u2019t working. He had 5 brand new portable window units at the ready and installed within minutes. \n", "The partners in our company needed a focused getaway with no distractions and this was a perfect fit. The place was great, hosts were excellent, layout perfect. Parts of the neighborhood were still pre-gentrified but we walked to food, bars and even downtown. \n\nBonus points to the hosts for finding us a whiteboard for our meetings!\n\nWe'll be back for sure.", "This was a fantastic house to stay in with a really great host.

The place has a Nespresso machine, which is very cool but we had only 4 pods one of which was decaf. So we enjoyed the coffee at home for 1 day, the rest of the time you either have to hunt down a Nespresso boutique to buy the pods, or buy coffee somewhere else."], "ratings": [4], "availability": "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNYYY"},

It was a wonderful house for our party of 8 people. The additional guest house ensured everyone had their own space, as well. Prior to check in, we enjoyed lunch at the Oasis overlooking Lake Travis, which is just minutes away.

From the moment we checked in to find a bottle of wine and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies waiting for us, to the moment we checking out, Melody was amazing! Chef Mike from Nola Kitchen was also recommended to us and it was such a fun experience to be able to go from laying out at the pool all day to having a private chef come cook and clean for us. Thank you for a great stay! 10/10 recommend this property", "I can't decide what I loved more: the view, the location, or the pool and outdoor spaces. The kiddos had a lot of fun swimming with their grandparents in the pool. They thought the waterfall was very cool. The house had everything you could need when away from home.

Flames were so high the he had to move the sprinkler over to help control the fire.\nOh yeah did I mention that there was no water pressure in the house which ment no running water in the sinks and no shower and the toilets only flushed in the morning.\nI should have mentioned that there was no clear instructions about how to turn on the space heaters. so we were cold all night.

Rep knew that the coffee pot did not match the machine.  Had to prop pot with dish in order to get coffee to drip.  I have rented a several homes in Austin.  This is the first that wasn't with a properly equipped kichen. Then the lack of hand towels and the 2 poor quality dirty smelling bath towels.  It was avery expensive stay, about $225 a day.

Mireille was very accommodating and easy to communicate with as well!", "Location was best part, other than that the bed was comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with cookware. The living space lacked comfort for us. The neighborhood was great for walking the dog and in between two great trails. There is a new grocery store a block away, Fresh Plus.", "I loved it... I fell in love with it immediately. It's a little nest to get some rest and recuperate. That said, there are neighbors who don't like loud talking or music so we had to do all of our partying out and then come back and go to bed. All in all, it was a nice weekend get-away.", "Our family of 4 stayed here for two nights. It's one of 3 or 4 units an old house but it (ground floor) has been kept clean and has new paint and an updated bathroom. It's quite small, a cute one person apartment, but it worked for our weekend. The location was great, everything seemed just minutes away. There were several restaurants down Lynn but nothing close enough to walk to besides those. UT was 5 minutes as was Congress and the highway. The only complaint we had was that the couch/bed was REALLY squeaky. I couldn't move without waking everyone up. The trundle bed was great for my kids and the snoring husband got the bedroom. They seemed fine with their beds. The AC in the kitchen was super loud so we didn't run it and the one in the family room was stuck on 67 so we were a bit cold when we slept. We didn't use the kitchen but it has a lot of space and was clean. Overall, it's a clean small place in a good location (unless you want to walk to everything). Note to the owner - maybe replace the bedframe, they're only like $100 on amazon, and the ac in the kitchen might be about to go out.", "I've got mixed feelings about my stay and overall I am not impressed. The main reason I stayed here is to experience Austin during a business visit and stay near 6th street. I thought I hit a jackpot when I saw the following in the property description:\n\nFew min walk to famous 6th St. and West Lynn\nWholefoods Market is only minutes away on foot\n\nThe first statement is misleading (the interesting part of 6th street is at least 35 mins walk) while the second statement is totally false (20 mins walk). The apartment is feels old and is also small (like it mentions cozy in a few places), so might struggle if there are two or more people staying. The bathroom was really tiny. Could've used few more cloth hangers (there were only 2 in the closet). Maybe if it gets renovated, might have a few more things going for this place. \n\nOn the positive side, the area was interesting even if it was totally residential with just a few shops nearby. Stay wasn't too expensive. Loved the e-locks. Running trails were nearby as well. \n\n", "This space is the perfect spot to get anywhere near downtown Austin. There were 3 of us and had more than enough room.\nWould definitely stay again!!!", "This cute place was very well kept and in such an awesome location/neighborhood - so many great places to eat and hang out downtown! The property owner was great and very responsive.", "I rented this property for my sisters and cousin. They come to town every year for Pecan Street Festival. The house was fantastic. Wonderfully clean and very well done. My sisters asked me to rent this place for them again for next year. They were very happy there. To be fair I didn't sleep there but was there for a good part of the time they were there. All reports were that the beds were very comfortable. I'd stay there in a heartbeat. Great location as it's central to everything. Looking forward to renting it again."], "ratings": [3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 4, 2, 5, 5, 5], "availability": "NNNNNNNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"},

Overall very well kept up and advertised correctly!", "We enjoyed our stay here when we traveled to Austin in late January. We have 7 people who fit comfortably (we used the sleeper sofa). The location put us close to 6th street which is where the reception was that we were attending. There were lots of restaurants in walking distance which was nice and there were multiple options for morning coffee and breakfast tacos (I'd recommend Lazarus). The private parking was a huge plus so we didn't have to deal with street parking and the condo had everything you would need for your stay (full kitchen, washer/dryer, etc). There were only two downside. One, the building was a bit of a maze and not well marked so it was difficult to find our way around. It would be nice if more specific directions as to how to find the unit were included in the email that explains the check in process. The second downfall (and the one thing that would keep me from renting this place again) was the fact that there was only one key fob for getting in and out of the building and through various doorways throughout the building. This was highly annoying when we had members of our family who wanted to go out in the evening while my husband and I returned to the condo with our young children. Because you need the key fob to get out of the garage and throughout the building at various doors when you are coming back in, it meant that those people going out had no way to get back IN when they were returning in the evening since we, the ones who went back to the condo, had the key fob (b/c we needed it to get in ourselves earlier). So we had to just have them call us at 1am when they got back and one of us would have to go down and let them in. It was very inconvenient. Aside from that, it was a lovely place to stay and communication with the host was easy and quick.", "Rating Details:\nThe property manager was very helpful.\nThe vacation rental was spotless.\nI was very happy with the location.\nI was very satisfied with the condition of the vacation rental.\nOverall, I recommend this vacation rental.\n\nReviewer Comments:\nThe condo was great!

The neighborhood was nice for walking our dog and restaurants we're within walking distance and a grocery store.

I wouldn't recommend having 8 people over for dinner, but in our case the food was taken elsewhere.

Cute neighborhood, coffee shop, restaurants, grocery store, drug store and park, all within a short walking distance. 3 stars: Space. Studio, plenty of room for two. Lots of natural light with windows at your feet and 15 feet up, none at eye level. For us, the space was crowded with too much furniture, although modern and nice quality. The foundation has a tilt toward the front door, which impacts: cooking (oil all runs to one side of the pan), sleeping (head of the bed falls downhill, enough to notice) and the ice maker thinks it\u2019s full as the ice piles up to one end (minor annoyance). During our 8 week stay, the oven did not work for 6 (a special part needed to be ordered). There is also an issue with water seeping from the bottom of the shower onto the bathroom floor, which needed constant monitoring. The owner said this had never happened before and insinuated we were the cause. Although he did send a handyman, the issue remained. Which brings me to the 1 star: Communication with the owner. All was fine until we disagreed with him showing the unit to prospective renters while were in the space (maybe you would be fine with this, we were not). E-mails about that issue and repair items (shower and stove) were lengthy, argumentative and condescending. When we asked for all communication to be via phone calls, he didn't seem as eager to communicate in person and our last few weeks were quiet.", "Great neighborhood close to downtown very comfortable", "Great place.

The best feature of this house though is absolutely its location. We were so close to everything! We rented some bikes for the weekend and never used our car once! We went to Zilker Park and a few different pools around the area. My personal favorite though was going down Barton Springs road and trying all the amazing Austin food. Aside from the house, the service that came with it from ARRIVE was something else.

The gorgeous garden kept us entertained with bird and squirrel action, and there are interesting things to look at all through the house.  We were welcomed by an outstanding basket of goodies upon arrival as well.  We walked home from the festival each night after getting a pedicab lift to the Congress Bridge, so it is a great location for the festival especially.  ", "My coworker and I stayed here during the SXSW festival this year. It was absolutely perfect. Aside from just being stunning, the house was immaculate - the owner even left us a welcome basket! I wanted to live there as soon as I walked in.\n\nQuick list of why we loved it: clean, safe, quiet, easy distance to downtown ($6 Ubers! for SXSW, we had no trouble going back and forth.) There's also a strip of restaurants even closer, which we unfortunately just did not have the time to check out. The beds are super comfortable, there are decks and patios galore, complete with a stunning view of Austin. It's clearly a chef's kitchen, with every appliance or item you'd need. Dana and the owner made booking our stay, getting in, and completing the reservation seamless. \n\nWe'd go back in a heartbeat! ", "From the minute we walked through the front door, I felt I was in a magical place. The phone booth right inside the front door is super cool. Both bedrooms were fantastic, beds comfortable and after playing with the upstairs shower nobs, very refreshing.  Dana left us a nice welcome basket and great instructions to start our long F1 weekend. Saturday night we enjoyed a refreshment on the upstairs patio and saw a magical sunset. We took cabs out at night to downtown and had no problem with cabs finding the location. I want to go back again soon!

Also, no pool towels- only bath.\nThe common area is a good size but there's only one couch and a non- lounging chair. Not enough space on that couch for the 3 of us to really tuck into a good show on the tv.\nThe only windows are on the S Congress side. The balcony is great but again, not enough furniture; two chairs and a table- not enough chairs for us to all sit and enjoy the very noisy traffic. \nFor some reason there's a cutout in the wall at the ceiling of the 2nd bedroom which is adjacent to the kitchen. I wake up early and like to have a cup of coffee and watch the news. This was a little disruptive to my husband who was still asleep in that bedroom.\nThe kitchen cupboard was unusually bare bones. Perhaps this was because we were there at the tail end of the pandemic, I'm not sure. There were no spices ( not even salt and pepper) or cooking oils. They provide Folgers coffee and I'm a coffee snob so I had to go buy some beans. \nThe pool is great and not crowded.\nThere's a terrific coffee shop called Cosmic right across the street w cool outside seating and water features and a couple food trucks. We spent a lot of time there. \nWe will rent from Wander Jaunt again in this building but try a quieter interior unit overlooking the pool. The location is perfect for us.

Parking and access to the property was a breeze. The apartment itself has been completely redone and presents a clean, polished look. The place was quiet, so we were able to rest and enjoy a good night's sleep. Overall, the property is old, and the courtyard not as nice as depicted in the photos. Observations: Bedroom 1, the one with the ensuite, had only one night stand, no bedside lamp, and no ceiling fan. The bath tub in the adjoining bathroom has a relatively slick bottom and no grab handles anywhere and had only one towel hook and no towel bars. Wet towels had to be thrown over the shower curtain rod. The toilet paper holders in both bathrooms are improperly installed. They are located behind the user and when the toilet paper is pulled, the entire roll comes off the holder. Reversing them would fix this problem. The second bedroom had a table lamp and a table, but no additional furniture. Suitcases had to be unpacked on the bed or floor. No luggage stands in either bedroom. The living room has one table lamp with a 25W bulb which made reading while sitting on the sofa impossible. The pool appeared to be closed--heavy chain and lock on the gate. We didn't plan on swimming , but if we had, doing so was not possible. Coffee maker had not been serviced and the used filter and grounds removed. Kitchen faucet is loose, and the sink is the deepest I have ever seen in a kitchen--not a plus. There were four ice trays in the freezer. Two were empty and one had two dead gnats in it. One ice cube in another ice tray had a long, black hair frozen just below the surface. We rent VRBOs frequently. When there is no ice maker, the ice bucket and ice trays are empty and clean.

With that being said, the host sends an aggressive message informing me that \u201cTHAT THIS IS NOT A PARTY HOUSE. THE NEIGHBORS WILL CALL THE POLICE IMMEDIATELY. JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A HEADS UP. PLEASE NO NOISE PAST 9PM\u201d. The upstairs guests/tenant? (this is a 4-plex) were very loud in and out of their unit. This is an old drafty and creaky house with thin walls, no insulation and hardwood floors. So you hear every units noise. So although we were quiet, the upstairs guest were not and kept us up/woke us up at night. The picture in profile is from kitchen looking into the living room. Lots of windows so natural light (and car lights at night along with noise). Bathroom is small but gets the job done. The ceiling fans have 2 speeds (fast and off), the space heaters work surprisingly well. It is window units only, we came in early Spring so we didn\u2019t need to turn them on. There were sticky notes on the thermostats and we were not allowed to adjust them. Lots of towels, spare blankets and pillows (had to do some searching) and basic kitchenware and a brita filter. Good Wifi and tv (basic local channels). It is on a big lot and in a pretty walkable/dog friendly neighborhood and if you bring a dog (we brought a service animal) they will enjoy their walks. Location is central if you\u2019re doing Hill Country or city of Austin stuff. It did what it needed to do. The initial \u201cnoise\u201d message from the host is incredibly off putting but as long as you follow the rules and aren\u2019t a light sleeper I think you\u2019ll be fine. You don\u2019t live there, it\u2019s just a place to call \u201chome base\u201d.", "To try to keep and short I booked this place for my wedding weekend and was completely ripped off.. property owner notified my few hrs before my arrival of a crack in a window that could not be repaired during my stay which as long as it was only a cosmetic issue I had no problem with it.. plus it was too late anyway! Upon my arrival it\u2019s 25 degrees in the middle of a Texas winter storm and the unit has NO HEAT! there is posted signs to use space heaters which barely blow warm air at all plus you can only plug in a few at a time because the power will shut off forcing me to go outside over and over to flip the breaker box. The window crack! Wasn\u2019t just that! The bottom of the window seal is fully separated from the wall allowing cold air into the unit making matters worst! I contacted owner about all of this and she replied with basically use space heaters and if power goes out go outside to the breaker box and repeatedly mentioned how she lost power for 7 hrs?! I was completely lost on what any of that had to do with not having heat or properly working appliances in the unit because I only lost power because of plugging in space heaters !!! She advertised there was a working heater in bedroom...completely untrue as I made several videos of this! I come from a family that had to make due in the winter with out heat so I kept my spirits up I mean it is my wedding weekend.. so I thought I\u2019d use the oven as a source of heat. NOPE THAT DOESNT WORK EITHER !! the only luck I had with keeping my hand and toes from being numb was turning on the gas stove with my hands over it like some campfire. Sounds ridiculous but I thought to my self that I\u2019m so happy I don\u2019t have children because it would be completely unsafe for them to be there.. after my wedding my wife spent the second night with me and the conditions completely ruined her day! This is honestly my first ever review because I never complain about anything and would never want to jeopardize anyone\u2019s business or reputation but I\u2019m hoping the owner or someone sees this and just fix the issues for the next guess.. awesome location unit has great potential! Unfortunately my stay was anything but great.", "I enjoyed my stay! Would highly recommend this place!", "I only stayed for 1 night. Everything that was listed and pictured was on point. I will stay here again soon and will highly recommend to others!", "Only one heater was provided so it was a little cold at first but overall the place looked just like the pictures and we all enjoyed our stay.", "The place is adorable and in a really great part of Austin if you're looking for easy access to downtown and affordability of short term rentals. My only issue was really thin walls and being able to hear people above us so clearly (young people partying loudly), but that is not a reflection of this listing, it's more of what you're looking for and ok with in terms of your experience.", "I was really impressed with this property in terms of space and location. It sleeps 6 but if you have a smaller group, there is plenty of room for everyone to move around, considering it's a one bedroom property. It was about a mile+ walk to Austin city center, but I like to walk so that was fine. It was about a $7 Uber ride. There are plenty of trendy restaurants and shops along the walk to enjoy. It's on a busy road. You can definitely hear the traffic from inside the apartment, but unless you're the fussy type, it's well-worth the other advantages and affordable price point. I will seek out this same property when I return to Austin. ~Crystal", "The heat issue in this house is borderline camping. Even with all 3\u00a0 heaters going, we felt like we were outdoors in a tent. We wew not allowed to use thermostat. The tips of our noses were constantly cold and it was not comfortable nor pleasant to be cold all the time while paying to stay here. We avoided coming \"home\" because it was not a place we wanted to spend anymore time than we absolutely had to.\n\nMy second biggest complaint is regarding the people who live or rent the upstairs units. They did not allow us to sleep more than an hour each night as they were constantly going up and down the stairs all night, moving furniture around (or so it sounded like) which made the house shake. Not to mention the dog barking and all the talking and stomping around. The old house has very thin walls.\n\nThe kitchen had mugs in the cupboard full of dirty water and the toilet rocks everytime you sit on it.\n\nIt was a very unpleasant experience.", "We enjoyed the location of the home very much. It\u2019s a quick ride or Uber from most areas. The only complaint we had was the bedroom window air conditioniner, it was horrible. It never cooled and had 3 crazy loud \u201cgears\u201d. Other then that is was nice.", "The apartment was clean and very appropriate for us and our (sometimes) visiting grandchildren. We enjoyed our 11day stay. The apartment is close to good restaurants and a good grocery store. The Medici cafe is a super coffee shop and breakfast venue which we enjoyed several times. The Neus drug store is a pharmacy and has a l950s type stool and milk shake facility located about two blocks from the apartment. When we return to Austin, we plan to stay there again. 100% positive experience. William and Judy"], "ratings": [2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5], "availability": "NNNNNNNNNNNYNNYYYYYYYYNYYYYYYYYY"},

If you're in town to visit the university and you need to be by the University, this unit will work. However, if you're looking to enjoy your accommodations on your hard earned vacation, this is probably not the place for you.\n\nFirst off, the floors were really dirty, despite being \"cleaned.\" Our feet and socks were dark with grime the whole time. We resolved ourselves to wearing shoes/sandals in the house most of the time. The master bathroom sink smelled like dirty dog for some reason. Also, those nighttime roaches scurrying across the floor don't give the impression that the unit is kept tidy on a regular basis. It's also the small things: It's not that hard to put liquid soap dispensers that work well in the unit. My wife said it well: You don't realize how much work the hospitality field is, until you get to a place like this. The details matter. \n\nCheck-in instructions and getting into the unit with parking were fine, except the pedestrian gate code was reported incorrectly in the instructions. Upon requesting the code, it was shared fairly quickly. We had to request that the very very loose toilet seat be tightened and appreciated the fact that it was fixed early the next Monday morning. The Roku was out of batteries and it took a while to figure out what was wrong with the TV. Again, details . . .\n\nThe positives: this rental is in a fantastic location, if you'd like to be by the University. There's a food truck pod just a block away and plenty of inexpensive and tasty brick and mortar restaurants nearby. Shoal Creek with parks and running/walking/biking trails is only four blocks away. All the services related to residing near a major university are there. That part is great!\n\nThe building itself is newish, but the unit itself has a lot of wear and tear: torn mini-blinds, chipped floor tiles, laminate floor trim missing, etc. We really appreciated having secure parking. Got the impression the building was marketed to higher end student populations and lower end young professionals.\n\nThis unit is a good value, but we probably would not choose to stay here again.", "We really liked staying at this property and loved how it made available different suggestions on where to eat and things to do", "Unit was nice, clean, roomy.

That means from the welcome to the exit it feels like a 5 star hotel.  The kitchen is gourmet but lacks many basics one would use for cooking (ditto on the Grill as we had to request grill tools).  Linens were basic where I would expect luxury towels both inside and out.  The touch faucet died on our last night there making it hard to do any clean up.  The space is gorgeous, well laid out and the furniture is comfortable.  The experience dims when I have to hang my clothes on a cheap rack next to the bed.  I understand this is a home away from home but think there were big misses.

My group was comprised of middle aged professionals and the time we spent on the pool slide took us back to our adolescence. We went down the slide and ran back to the top to do it again like children. It was a blast! \nThe issue we had with this house is that it is a home to family with three children. They live here full time. Because of this, the management company felt intrusive. \nWe were very up front with our plans to have a birthday party for my wife at the house and it was approved by the owners.\nIn our effort to be compliant with the house rules, I notified the management co. that we had more than 4 cars in the driveway because we had hired a massage therapist for the afternoon. Management sent someone to the house unannounced and that person interrupted a massage to ask for her license. \nThat evening we received a noise complaint when there was no noise outside. We had an indoor party and when I got the text about the noise, I went outside and the crickets were louder than any noise coming from the house. I think the neighbors are not pleased about the house being rented out. \nThe operations manager of Above called me a few days later and apologized for the issues we had. The folks at Above were all very nice and accommodating. \nWe did have a great time, but I would not rent this place to have a gathering with friends. It's ideal for a super quiet, family retreat.", "Enjoyed our stay. We\u2019re disappointed that fire pit wasn\u2019t working. Loved the slide. Really enjoyed pool time.

Also,Arrive claims that they have to come to the house every day to &#x201C;clean up&#x201D; but they don&#x2019;t clean. They just make sure you aren&#x2019;t doing anything wrong, like a baby sitter.   This home is controlled by an app in which they arrive person assigned tot he house has. The App turned on off the pool likes, water features, hot tub ext. and when we were out they would shut it off to save propane and would argue with me when I would ask to turn it on. When you rent a place for this amount of money, you want to feel like you have full access to luxuries that you&#x2019;re paying for. It does not feel that way.   The home owners seem to have a ton of rules that make staying there a non relaxing experience. If some one is so particular about their house they shouldn&#x2019;t rent it out. Example - 100.00 fine of furniture is moved. Can&#x2019;t adjust the thermostats or they will charge 300.00 to reset them etc..

The property manager was also very quick to answer any questions we had. In general the whole process from check in to check out was stress-free. \n\nOne thing that would be nice for future visitors is maybe a guide on how to use the TV. We brought an HDMI cable and hooked up a laptop to stream shows after we struggled to figure out the remote controls for a bit. Not a huge deal for us, but other families might find that important.

We arrived late and Melisa allowed our chef to unload and get settled! She even assisted the chef with deets of the kitchen & common areas as she waited on us to arrive. Did I mention Melisa the home manager even had our favorite libation ready as a gift when we arrived!!  Melisa is so bubbly, helpful and sweet!

I heard more people in the apartment complex. But overall it was a good location. Really spacious and close to shops and dinning.", "The location to this place is prime in downtown Austin. The Kasa property management is abysmal. I was never sent check in documentation, which IS needed because it is contact-less. So upon reaching the property, I had to call customer service to find out how to get in, and then wait for a while for them to figure out why the verification I confirmed multiple times was supposedly not received. \n\nThe entrance/elevator badges need to be held up about 10 seconds each time which led to a lot of frequent confusion/frustration about them seeming to not work. \n\nWhen I got to the room, it ended up being a DIFFERENT one from what I booked here on VRBO. That would have been helpful to know because this one had a large bathtub and a washer/dryer and I would have packed differently to enjoy both accordingly if I\u2019d known to expect those amenities. (Also, there was no communication about why was I not in the room I booked. Kasa has several VRBO listings and I reviewed all of them before making my selection intentionally, so this was a noticed, unaddressed change on their part.)\n\nWhen I decided to extend my stay by a night (because the location itself is great), Kasa treated that as an entirely new reservation which meant that I got locked out of my room when the door code expired, and I had to call customer service again (I probably reached out 5 times over the entire four-night stay) to find out what happened. I discovered that yet again, they\u2019d never sent check in documentation for this \u201cnew\u201d reservation. \n\nTo their credit, Kasa has an awesome customer support team who typically answered questions very promptly and are super helpful over the phone, and I did receive a partial credit back towards the stay. So their attempts to rectify the situation were helpful and appreciated. I would book the stay again for the location (and the bed was super comfy!), but they have a lot of room for improvement towards their basic customer communication, and I would adjust your expectations accordingly."], "ratings": [5, 3], "availability": "NNNYYNNNNNYYNNNNNYYYNNNYYYYYYYYY"},

The decor of the clifftop estate is very unique and expressive complimenting the spacious layout. The calming atmosphere is ideal for everything from relaxing/zoning out to family style dinner.

The layout is unique to say the least - my husband and I travelled with our two teens and there are only two bedrooms within the main structure of the house (king and queen bedrooms.)

When I contacted the management company I was informed that each rental is provided with a starter kit of paper products and if renters run out you are expected to provide your own. That seems perfectly acceptable for paper towels and coffee filters but not for toilet paper( we were provided a partial roll for our stay). Luckily, we had an emergency stash in the car, but it seems that toilet paper should be provided for the duration of your stay.

There is nothing like it - we loved every minute we spent here admiring the architecture, the quiet woods, and the swanky interior. This place was a world of its own and it felt miraculous to have the opportunity stay in such a unique and exquisite space!", "PROS: A very interesting structure! This is a one-of-a-kind experience and opportunity. A very cool house indeed. Easy keyless/hostless access. Full kitchen. Climate control. Comfortable (albeit small) bed and seating. Easy communication with rental agency. Private. Views of mostly nature. \n\nCONS: Remote (no where near town, which can be good if you\u2019re looking to get away.) Broken, and nearly dangerous dirt/rock road that can\u2019t handle smaller cars and will dirty up even the biggest SUV. *Very* steep, windy, narrow path with sparse and dim lights is the only way to access the property. No driveway access (off limits for being even steeper than the path, but not by much.) The house has a very chemical smell (probably from all the sprayed on ceiling and plastic foam) that can be very unpleasant if you are sensitive or have allergies. Not at all quiet during the day. Major construction going on nearby means constant beeping and rumbling from industrial trucks coming in and out of the shared road and building the nearby houses. We had hoped to get away from the city noise and couldn\u2019t even keep the windows open because it was so disruptive. Which means we were trapped in the closed up house with the irritating plastic smell. This was a big downer for us because we were looking for a little peace and quiet and fresh air while on vacation. There is a small detached utility shed nearby that gives off a whining hum constantly, which can be a nuisance if you have good hearing or are sitting on the patio.\n\nTIPS: Arrive in daytime when you can see where you\u2019re going. Drive a vehicle capable of navigating off road, not a cute convertible rental that will get damaged from flying rocks and debris. Grocery shop before getting there because stores are not nearby and once you get all your stuff carted down from the access road above you\u2019re definitely not going to want to go all the way back up the hill and out again. Make sure to bring all the food and ingredients you want, as the property does not provide even simple basics like sugar. Pack light or you will be carting big suitcases up and down this dangerous path, possibly in the dark. Ask manager if the construction has been completed before renting if you are concerned about ambient noise.\n\nThe house is totally unique. Aside from the above mentioned issues, we were generally comfortable and enjoyed the \u2018experience\u2019 of staying in such a special place, but we just cannot give it a full 5 stars. \n", "This was a 3 night Hideaway for my wife and I to get away from everything. It could not have been better. This beautiful, clean, tasteful, weird, little hideaway was PERFECT! We decided not to go out to restaurants as we were too comfy and fascinated. Knowing the history added so much to the trip. Bottom line - exactly what we wanted, and needed", "We had a great weekend in this very special home.

With all the uncertainty, we simply had no reason to stay another day. However, I think it is important to note that during this time of unprecedented uncertainty... if you arrive and something causes you concern, or your plans change due to this outbreak, you will not get a refund. The *management* company offered me a night after I expressed concern for this unusual circumstance, but I am declining that offer because as a business owner myself, I truly do not want to take away from the fragile market at this time. Vacation homes and hotels are suffering as much as anyone. Had the owner agreed to a one night refund, I would have felt better about it. After my departure, I did receive an email from the company president saying they encouraged all owners to be flexible when plans change since this is such a difficult time for everyone and things are changing quickly.
