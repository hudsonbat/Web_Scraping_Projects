The front desk lady was very sweet and kind. Our room wasn\u2019t clean when we got in there. We know it\u2019s a condo and not a hotel and grew up in ocean city every single summer, we know what to expect and we\u2019re really not unrealistic people at all\u2026 but there was used dental floss in the living area, food behind the couch pillows, dirt and sand everywhere, and the shower curtain had red mold all over it.

TV and basic cable helps: I got to watch some of the NBA Conference Championships and cable news in the morning. The kids and I played air hockey and foozball in the game room when it rained. There is a laundry room on the Second Floor with free detergent - they worked great. This is an undersold perk of the rental, IMHO. Front desk and building staff were SUPER nice to us.\n\nA few cons: the building is showing some signs of age, and an air-conditioned lobby might be nice. Some of the VRBO instructions, handouts, and front-desk instructions conflicted on things like check-out and air conditioning. Our unit also didn't have tissues or dish towels. Unit was very clean.

There were 8 females in our group, and 2 rolls of TP didn't cut it for 4 nights. Also, while there is a vacuum, there is no broom and dust pan. Being at the beach, you are gonna have sand everywhere.

I was totally disappointed with this one. \n\nThe condo offers amazing views of the beach ans ocean from an ample size balcony! High table and captain chairs were nice to sit in! Had a table with no chairs though. \n\nThe kitchen needs to be updated. But good space. Cabinets offered dishes and glassware but the cupboards smelled so I didn\u2019t use them. The chairs at the dining table were dirty and uncomfortable to sit in. The floor mats all through the home were very dirty\u2026no filthy! Bathroom mats as well. The rug to go onto the balcony should be replaced as it old, dirty, torn and too nasty to even step on. Shower curtain should be tossed it has soap film on it. Should get the hotel like curtain for better cleanliness. New toilet is needed as well. \n\nBest thing was the comfortable King bed, which offered and amazing view of the ocean, and it was an ample sized bedroom with a door leading to balcony. Only bummer was no TV in the bedroom. \n\nLiving room TV was great size! The couch was comfy but the pillows on couch and in the chairs need to be washed as they were filthy as well or simply replaced.  \n\nLastly, the AC was not working in the open floor planned area for the Kitchen, dining, and living room area. I called maintenance and no one showed. So there I was in a hot condo in 85-90 degree weather! Thank goodness for the ceiling fans!", "The AC unit in the bedroom was filthy with mildew and the smell was terrible. It was hot and humid outside which gave us no choice to put the AC unit on. Whoever during the night we had to turn it off due to the smell was so overwhelming and started to hurt our lungs everytime we inhaled. We had to sleep with the bedroom door open in order to get some coolness from the AC unit in the living room. The closets had a terrible smell so did the kitchen cabinets. It all Smelled Mildewy. This place needs to be remodeled. What we paid For this unit for 3 nights was way over priced. It was such a disappointment. We couldn\u2019t wait to leave the moment we opened the door to this unit. We went out and brought candles to cover up the smell and it still smelled bad. This unit felt like a dirty motel. However we did have a good time at the beach and pool thankfully. All our belongings we took came back with the smell of Mildew. I do hope the owner Remodels this unit. So sorry for the insult. However the Building was kept clean and so was the pool. Also you have to pay for parking which makes no sense since it\u2019s in the complex parking lot. That should be included when you rent the place. By the way you have to scrub the tub when you check out. Never heard such a thing.", "I love the location! It\u2019s close to the beach and our view was awesome.

However.. the condo it\u2019s self was gross. I was so upset. Upon arrival is smelled and was stagnant. We received an email saying to allow extra time for deep cleaning to help with COVID. Meanwhile, this place looked and smelled like it had not been cleaned at all. The unit was completely outdated which would have been okay if it was at least clean! I had to go buy cleaning products just to scrub the floors and bathroom. In addition the bathroom truly smelt like there was a dead animal in it I\u2019m not kidding. We had to leave the vent on the entire trip just to help dissipate the smell. There were clean towels and new mini shampoo bottles. So someone had to have brought those items and somehow deemed that condo \u201cclean.\u201d Far from it. So in ending, the complex and location was great but find a different unit!

The checking was easy and with no complications. Turnkey sent me all the information necessary ahead of time for check in, the  address, the door code which was really great and I did not need to be calling anyone for that. However, when we arrived we have noticed left over food in the fridge even though you could see the fridge looked clean. So we started inspecting things all over to fond out the plates were dirty in the cabinet, the two sliding doors were giving us trouble to open, the Main Tv on the living room was not working which was a bummer taking into consideration I had a toddler that loved TV and we really needed to be creative. The fridge would not close appropriately and we always needed to make sure was closed all times. The utensils, pot and pans needed an upgrade, nothing matched and some utensils had seen better days with some of them with rust. I do understand that this property is a rental but the basics should be in place like pots and pans because we were a family of 6 and we cooked all our meals at home Bc we did not wanted to be at restaurants because of COVID-19. The parking spot for this unit is very challenging if you are coming with a big car like us such as our Ford Expedition it was always nightmare because a three was curved right toward to that parking spot. If you have families with small children be aware that even though they say families are welcome the neighbors will complaint about noise which I do not understand someone to complaint about noise at 9pm? I get if it was over 10pm and I think they complained to the wrong unit Bc we only had a toddler that does not speak and go to bed early living us with 5 adults playing board games. Our unit Neighboor had 4 small children that could be heard at the hall way but once inside the unit I could not hear them.

Second bedroom also does not have cable. The furniture is not particularly comfortable either, not a ton of room for a family. The last complaint is that the unit across from us was rented to a group of young (early 20s I\u2019d guess) individuals who threw an extremely loud party. All in all I won\u2019t be back.

The condo itself lacks common items found in most. The kitchen was not outfitted for cooking and missing major staples like pots, pans, dishes, and a can opener. There was also no coffee pot, but there was a Keurig. It would have been nice to know in advance since K-Cups weren&#x2019;t provided. The dining table has an unsecured glass top, the DirecTV wasn&#x2019;t working, and the couch was so worn you couldn&#x2019;t sit on it.

The management company was helpful and quick to send someone to clean once they heard our place wasn&#x2019;t clean, but we had already cleaned it.

The location is perfect! We always loved our stays at the Century 1 and we have never been disappointed!

There is a pull out bed in the living room but if the guest(s) using that bed need to use a bathroom they will have to enter one of the bedrooms first to get to a bathroom. Other than that the layout is lovely and certainly takes advantage of the views on both the ocean side and the bay side. The furnishings and amenities (electronics, decor, blankets/pillows etc) are certainly dated and have been heavily used, but were functional and since we have children, we are used to that. There were a couple minor issues when we arrived that I did reach out to Wendy about and she was incredibly responsive and sent someone over to address. They were able to fix one issue but not the other, which was a broken closet door. We were able to work around it by not using the closet. Perhaps in the wake of Covid, our cleanliness expectations are high, but we did give the place a quick once over when we arrived because it needed to be swept up and the floors/bathrooms were still sandy/dirty from previous tenants. Again, we have children and I am used to this, so not the biggest deal. Having a washer and dryer on site was a huge plus and the pool in the facility was also popular with my kids. The gym was surprisingly small for such a large building and did not seem to be air conditioned, but having it on site was still a nice bonus. \nOverall this place was lovely, safe, and had everything we needed. The view of the ocean from the 16th floor was absolutely breathtaking.

We were very pleased .", "I decided to book a quick girls trip for my elderly mother, my 19 year old and 10 year old daughters, and myself. My mother can't walk far which is why we chose this unit and beach location. The directions for the self check-in key pad were wrong, but we figured it out. The neighbor came by and tried to help. Very nice guy. The area was pretty quiet and low key too, which was nice upon arrival. \n\nHowever entering the unit, you could feel the dampness and there was a musty smell. The air conditioner wasn't on and didn't kick on the whole time we were there. \n\nThe unit appears clean at first glance, but once you start looking around...it's quite filthy. The dishes had food on them, spills inside the cupboard, the ice maker didn't work, the floors left your feet black, dust everywhere, shower kept backing up...it was gross. We ate out the whole time and I didn't even use the coffee pot *which is HUGE since coffee is LIFE! The cable TV was a bit of a PITA too! There were hardly any channels and annoying talking subtitles that were hard to get off. We wound up using the Netflix/Disney+ channels that were from people who failed to log off before they left.\n\nHowever, I didn't see a single bug the whole time and our sliding doors opened up to a nice view of the dunes, a lovely breeze and the sound of the ocean. The proximity of this unit to the beach is what saved our short trip. My youngest enjoyed using the provided beach toys (we even added a few to the collection). \n\nThis place could be a real gem if it were updated and thoroughly cleaned.", "It was a nice location but could have been slightly cleaner that was overlooked. Small ice cream dish was left in freezer from previous renters. Just feel like for the price cleanliness issues should have not been overlooked. Overall stay was good. Will prob not stay here again.", "this was a great birthday weekend get away with my boyfriend; the location was great; the place was very clean; amazing right on the beach", "Plus, the property was on the beach and on the 1st floor. I was disappointed upon walking in, it smelled damp and moldy. The place needs some updating, the vents need cleaning because there was so much dust in them, the walks could use a coat of paint, there was rust everywhere and the sofa has stains and spots all over it, so much so that I wouldn't sit on it ot the chair without covering it with the sheet set that was placed underneath the TV in the living room, the head board to the 1st bed you come upon when you walk into the bedroom is about to fall off of the wall and the mattress covers were dingy and stained. When we finished wiping with disinfect all over the unit,, showered and got into bed the sheets felt moist from the dampness in the unit. I've never been so let down.", "Overall, there are some minor annoyances, but we really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay again.\n\nPros: \nThe location is absolutely excellent. It's near everything there is to do in Ocean City, but still at a quieter part of the beach away from the boardwalk. \n\nThe back porch has a beautiful view of the dunes (not the ocean, but you can still hear it) and I spent a lot of time just sitting out there in the sun and relaxing. \n\nIt's a very short walk onto the beach directly out the back door, and there are beach chairs and umbrellas for use, which was really nice.\n\nThe kitchen is very well-stocked (even a French press!) and the place was overall very clean, which is comforting in days of Covid.\n\nCons:\nAs other reviews have mentioned, the dampness was definitely noticeable, though it wasn't a huge problem at the time of our stay in late October with the weather being relatively cool. I might have been more bothered by it if it were very hot as well.\n\nIn general, the place does need a bit of updating. The beds, or at least the mattresses, need to be replaced, and there are almost no outlets in the bedroom.", "The condo was in a great location, and right on the beach which was great. The place itself needs a few upgrades. The air-conditioning unit in the bedroom was loud, which would have been fine if we could have just set it to run continuously. Instead it cycled on and off which was frustrating. Also, the toilet in the main bathroom appears to be needing repair -- the bolts holding it down are rusted. Finally, there were crumbs on the carpet. While it smelled like bleach when we checked in, it seemed to me to just make us feel better about staying there during COVID. I think with a little money spent on fixing up the unit, not just on cosmetic repairs, it would be a worthwhile place to revisit again.", ".", "This place was spotless, had all tile floors! Easy to keep clean. Great kitchen, great location! Great service as well. Bed was comfy- but let\u2019s fix those headboards. Pullout was very useful.

I have never stayed in something so small and not clean for something this expensive. Pictures were deceiving. Another thing I didn't like was the only spot for my baby's pack n play was near the closet in one bed bedroom. When you open doors you can see air filter is completely full, dirty and gross. At the end of our trip my baby was wheezing and sick with a cold. The place did its job as we went there to go to the beach but definitely could have been cleaner. This property also has very thin walls where we heard the neighbors both next to us and above us, thankfully our baby slept through that. Will not be returning.", "I brought my crawling one year with me to this trip and was furious at the fact that the floor looked like it had not been cleaned in months. The couch had trash under it so you could tell no one had cleaned. Let\u2019s talk about the communication with the property manager. After I submitted my complaint of the hygiene in the place, no one ever came to talk to me or try to make up for it. Not sure how the listing says covid cleaning when it is no where close to that.", "Amenities were upgraded from our last visit. The location is noisy.", "Clean, comfortable and convenient. We will definitely book again. The on site pool and security was a plus. We were in walking distance from the excitement and the environment was very clean and noise appropriate.", "Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this property. It was not clean at all. I was terrified to sit on the furniture so I ended up covering the couch and beds with my own sheets. Random chairs (that looked like they were literally pulled out from a dumpster) were so incredibly stained and disgusting. Shower was not cleaned and did not drain properly so when you took a shower you were standing in about half an inch of water. What was most appalling was the fact that the comforter on one of the beds had stains and crusted dry food or something, but what made this more concerning was the fact that someone\u2019s review in April complained of the exact same thing. This unfortunately tells me that the blankets on the bed are NEVER washed. What made it worse was it seemed that the person \u201ccleaning\u201d flipped the stained side over so guests wouldn\u2019t notice?? \nAll bedsheets looked like they had been ironed on the bed rather than washed, hairs, lint, crumbs, etc all over. The towels had several hairs in them. \nIn addition, though I know the owners don\u2019t have control over what occurs outside the building, just a warning, if you want to actually sleep at night, don\u2019t book this room. There were people in the parking lot next door partying and playing loud music all night long. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re into and you don\u2019t mind filth, then this place is for you.\nI rarely ever leave bad comments/reviews but I felt I needed to for this property. People rely heavily on reviews when booking and this was really disappointing. What bothers me most is that in a time like this (Covid) you would think that the owners/property company would ensure cleanliness was a top priority for guests. I will not be booking anything through Vacasa again and I\u2019ll be sure to warn others.", "Clean and nice in cozy even tho the pool wasn\u2019t open", "This was the first time I booked through Vrbo. I am not sure who is actually responsible for contacting customers. Is it the owner? Vacasa? Jocelyn Manor? or someone at Vrbo? I reached out with questions upon my initial booking 2 weeks prior to my stay and my questions were not addressed. I received a generic email and text just prior to my stay with incorrect check in information. There is no office to check in with. There is no one at the property to answer questions. \nNo one to get a parking pass from. This made me a neurotic mess because there are warnings about your car being towed EVERYWHERE and the email and text received said I could get a pass from the office. However, upon arrival... there is No office. There was no one available via email. Nor phone. I was able to leave a message through the answering service.... but when I received a call back 1030 AM the following day the person was not familiar with the area. They told me to get in contact with the owner. Extremely frustrating.\nAnother note about poor communication - I received information that if I wanted to avoid going to the grocery store, there was the option to have your groceries delivered to the property. They would be delivered and kept at the office. I almost took full advantage of this because I thought it was a great idea. Again - no office. I have no idea where my groceries would have ended up?! oi vey. \n\nThis unit was also dirty. Furniture throughout the building was dirty and stained. The linens had caked/crusty food on them.\n\nVery very disappointing. I stayed only because 1. I brought my own bedding and extra linings and was able to drape them over the furniture. \n\nThe back had what seemed like a nice patch of green but there was trash in the back. \n\nI am writing this review because I feel I should be credited back 50% of my total if not a full refund. It is in poor taste to state this in a review but I cannot reach anyone and this is my only means of communication. \n\nAlso, just on a personal note, I would never stay at this place again because of the neighbor. He was constantly walking in front of my unit and hanging out, which was weird since I was at the end in the corner. Just made me feel very unsafe. I know it was beyond anyone's control but to make matters worse the building was being worked on and updated too. So much for having a peaceful breakfast after not being able to sleep as I kept thinking the tow truck was going to tow my car away. \nugh."], "ratings": [4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 2, 5, 1], "availability": "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYYYYYYYNNNYY"},

I had never heard of blankets not being available at any rentals before. But once we arrived we saw that there were plenty available for use in the unit! We didn't need to take them. Also, the wifi did not work.  My husband needed to make work zoom calls so that was a big issue. There was no way to reach Vacasa for help except thru email which was not answered.  No emergency numbers were provided in our confirmation, their website, nor were any posted inside the unit. Thankfully I found someone in the building who kindly came to the rescue.

The building was right on the beach. When we arrived at the condo building we were stuck outside because you need a fob to get in. The fob was located in the apartment. No one was at the security desk so we had to wait for other guests to let us in. The apartment was nice but dirty. There was orange sticky stuff on the door handles on the balcony and sand already in the bath tub. The cabinets were hanging off the hinges and the knobs to the closets came off in our hands. The air conditioner must have been preset and controlled remotely because the apartment never got below 74-78 degrees and it was a hot week. They sell a couple pool toys in the gift shop however pool toys are not allowed in the pool (pool rules do not list this.)They provide 4 plastic chairs for seating around the pool and you aren\u2019t allowed to bring any other chair into the pool. The game room, which is not owned by the Quay, ate a lot of our money and it\u2019s about 85 degrees in there so be prepared to sweat while fighting with the games to work. My family and I make the best of every situation so we had a nice week but I\u2019ll be a lot more picky next time I visit OCMD.", "It was our first time in OCMD and what an amazing beach week!

It never got down to the temp (72) I set it to and most of the times it would reset itself. For example, I set it for 72 and I\u2019d check it later and it was reset for 83. Not good, I can\u2019t sleep when it\u2019s that hot. \n\nSo they sent someone to fix and they never announced themselves being there. My seven year old daughter came out of the bathroom naked into her bedroom and the maintenance men were in her room and saw her naked. She was humilitiated and was crying.

Very close to the beach (perfect for walking with a toddler and all our stuff), functional for a short family stay. Communication with Casa and Vrbo was very easy. \n\nI knocked it down to a rating of 3 due to lots of little updates/fixes needed that caused safety concerns regarding our 1 year old. The deck had a nail sticking out of the floor that could have resulted in a trip to urgent care if not noticed and fixed by my husband. There is rusty and broken patio furniture outside, a loose panel on the side of the deck, and a large rip in the carpetting. Inside--an open trash can, doorknob locks that stick, cabinets without safety locks, and uncovered outlets all over. The last 2 items are not a huge deal but the other items really need to be fixed should we consider staying here next time. It also looked as though beneath the beds hadn't been vacuumed in quite a while. \n\nAgain, if you're staying with a group of adults, none of these things are a big deal, just kind of a bummer. We're thankful to have been able to book such a great location in OCMD! This was a fantastic alternative to the Jersey Shore.", "The location is excellent -- a three to five minute walk to a quiet part of the beach. It's also walking distance to some really good restaurants. \nVacasa, the management company that runs the property, is awful and completely unresponsive. When we arrived, the dishwasher was broken and had two inches of standing water in it. Vacasa's first response was that the dishwasher was \"a known problem\" and \"the owner does not intend to fix it.\" They offered us a $60 refund when we were paying almost four times that per night. Then Vacasa told us that they had only found out about the dishwasher a couple of days before our arrival and that a new machine was on order. When I asked for a plumber to come out and, at the very least, empty the water from the dishwasher. They increased the refund amount to $75. I didn't want a refund. I wanted the fully functioning kitchen that they advertised. The people who answer the phone for Vacasa have an Oregon phone number. They said the local property manager would contact us the following morning, but she never called or stopped by. They also refused to send out a plumber. \nWe also discovered and complained about the fact that the lint filter in the dryer was rusted and there were huge holes in the filter. This is a serious fire hazard because that means the exhaust tube is filling with lint from beach towels with every group that stays here. \nOcean City also requires a rental permit to be posted in all rental properties. The certificate posted in this place had expired in April 2020 and we stayed in this place in July 2021. \n The overhead lights in the bedrooms also don't work, but hey, it's really close to the beach and neither Vacasa, nor the condo owners, care about the condition of the property.", "The location is amazing. You are literally a block away from the beach. The beds were comfortable and the place was clean. The price was good for its location. The kitchen could use some renovation but it was still very functional. One of my friends needed to sleep on the couch which wasn\u2019t the comfiest. It is also a little sunk in but not that much of a big deal considering we weren\u2019t really in the room much.

The oven was dirty also. Another issue was the coffee maker, we had to go to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts every morning and had to spend a lot of money that we hadn\u2019t counted on. The main bathroom struggled to drain during a shower. WiFi was also a problem. 4 different people followed the instructions and we all got the message that it was the wrong password. Most of that was discovered on the first evening of our stay so I inquired about the WiFi, coffee maker and I didn\u2019t know where the parking pass was to put in the car. It\u2019s now the Wednesday that we were going home and I still haven\u2019t heard anything. ( I found the parking pass the next day) so we spent a lot of extra on coffee and all our phones ran out of data so that also cost us extra that hadn\u2019t been counted on.

We had to keep the patio doors closed and curtains drawn to maintain our privacy. And after they left there was wet paint and painting supplies left behind. Also due to the painters the pool was closed the entire trip.\n\nBesides the issues of the painters, the state of the condo itself was pretty bad.

Two of the three kitchen chairs were broken and just placed under the table like nothing was wrong. We only discovered this when my partner attempted to sit in one and it just fell apart.

He then insisted that I must be lying about all of the issues with this property because I didn't report them while we were there. We didn't report the issues because the chair didn't break until just a few days before we were scheduled to leave and there was nothing we could do about any of the other issues without spending vacation time to deal with finding a new place to stay. \n\nBasically this place sucks and is run by an absentee owner who will try to nickel and dime you for everything even though it's not your fault.

I guess it's a good thing neither of us were disabled in some way AND the pool was closed due to \"COVID\". The Governor removed restrictions and we were super excited to be able to wake up and go for an early morning or late evening swim. To us, it seemed an excuse for Pintail Point to not clean the pool. We were extremely disappointed, especially since surrounding buildings and hotels had their pools open. \n\nIn addition, there was a NEST HVAC thermostat. We spent the first night sweating because each and every time we adjusted the thermostat to 72 degrees it was readjusted to 84. It wasn't until the next day that we were able to actually sufficiently cool the condo down after emailing the property management company. In addition, don't expect much from the cable. I recommend bringing a device you can hook into the tv directly to watch your own paid programming. The cable subscription here is basic and you won't have much of a selection at all to watch and the volume on the bedroom tv wouldn't adjust. Oh well. \n\nDefinite plusses were the comfortable bed, large bathroom, balcony and view, the nicely supplied kitchen, and keyless entry.

You do need to watch your youngsters as there is plenty of details that are highly attractive to young curious hands. \n\nThe bay beach is not really suitable for swimming - the entire bay is rather shallow, but right next door is a (non motorized) water sports rental business - and the calm water is perfect for SUP, kayak or catamaran. To access the main beach, one needs to go across the Coastal Highway, which is the main street and although busy, it is very well lit and has plenty of traffic lights. Main beach can get crowded, but it's still large enough to accommodate plenty of people. The beach is good to enjoy the ocean especially if you like waves. \n\nThere are many places to eat near the condo and if crab is what you savor, you will be in Heaven. Boardwalk is a short drive away with plenty of attractions, including shops and amusement parks. There is definitely more to do than the days in your vacation.\n\nOne thing to notice though is that Ocean City is very much overbuilt - it is hard to find any green space left and what passes for a street in many instances is nothing more than a driveway - which can surprise some including the author of this review. \n\nThe only issue we experienced was the super high tech lock on the door of the condo which I wasn't able to open even though I followed the instructions.

This is the first, as I am certain that bed was filled with concrete. Once you get done tossing  and turning all night, your surprise is blinding morning light from the see through curtains. OC prices are high. To the owners, open your pockets, pull out $500, buy a mattress within the realm of \u2018reasonable\u2019 softness, and put up some $50 curtains that block the solar flares at sunrise.  A $20 hairdryer wouldn\u2019t kill the budget either.  Don\u2019t rent until you have written confirmation from Vacasa that the mattress and curtains are upgraded.", "it was so so nice to get away to the beach this summer with so many covid fears and restrictions.

The location is PERFECT, very close to the center of the boardwalk action but far enough away that it\u2019s quiet at night. The views from the balcony are beautiful. There is a bar on the first floor, which was neighborly and fun. We have stayed at many beach VRBOs so the one thing I would mention is it would be nice if linens/towels were included and if they had a supply of beach toys and chairs/umbrellas for renters to use.

With the travel, the kids and the storm, it was pretty miserable. Then, we got to the condo and was completely blown away! Not only was the place more spacious than we had expected, the view of the bay is spectacular. We spent 2 days indoors, but it was totally fine. We cooked in the roomy kitchen, played board games and watched movies in the comfy loving area. When the sun finally came out, we ventured out to the boardwalk, which is just within minutes of walking! Once you get to the boardwalk, you\u2019re right in the middle of the action. The condo was clean and well-kept. The major thing to keep in mind is that you need to bring many of your own things- bedsheets, pillowcases, garbage bags, toilet paper, soap, bath towels, hand towels, etc. The building was quiet and we felt very safe. Overall it was a pleasant stay, and we\u2019re already looking forward to coming back next year!", "You won't regret staying here!

I have a seven year old, four year old and one year old. My oldest two children are neurodiverse, and we consider property details when we vacation to ensure their safety and wellbeing. \n\nI chose this property because it was right on the beach and north of the busy parts of OCMD. We wanted to avoid other people as much as possible due to COVID. \n\nI also liked the spacious living room area to make sure the kids had good space to play and not run into anything. The furniture is kid friendly and set up in a way where little hands can't get into much. We only had to move some freestanding lamps out of the way, which was no big deal.\n\nThe gated deck was a huge plus, because we could send the kids out there (even the one year old) and see them from the big, beautiful, ocean-facing sliding glass doors. They were secure with the latch gate and got to soak up the sun for hours. \n\nThere is direct beach access which was great. The kids thought it was fun to walk down the \"secret path\" to get to the beach. \n\nAnother huge bonus for families was that we couldn't bring a baby gate and gate off the kitchen and hallway to keep the toddler out of things. That is always a plus to find in vacation homes so you don't need to worry about toddlers getting into cleaning supplies and stuff under the sink.\n\nThe hosts, Ashlee and Matt, were awesome and very communicative and helpful. We can't wait to plan another escape here, since it worked for our family in so many practical ways. \n\nThank you!", "We had a wonderful experience!

And the unit itself, with its 2BRs and 2 baths, full kitchen and living room, plus the spacious balcony overlooking the boardwalk were all great \u2014 just what I was expecting. But there were issues. The handle to the slider door that leads to the balcony was missing from ther door. I found it on top of the refrigerator. When my daughter turned on the water to take a shower in the main bath, the shower head popped off. Luckily it did not hit her or she could have been injured. Just before we left I was washing the few glasses we used by hand and noticed the water draining very slowly in the kitchen sink. I tried to turn on the in-sink disposal but it dIdn\u2019t work. Regarding the documentation provided by Vacasa prior to our visit, I found it somewhat confusing. There was a reference to an elevator repair that took place in December \u2014 we weren\u2019t sure if it would be working (it was, thank God, as we were on the 5th floor). Other notes suggested there would be no bedding. Or maybe there would be. It was contradictory.

You can get out, but you can\u2019t get back in unless you use 4th street to get around the back. I was able to get the code from someone staying at another Golden Beach unit.

Sadly, nothing was done to correct issues from other guest's reviews. \n\nLet me start by saying the location is absolutely amazing, the balcony is big and we ended up spending most of our time there. \n\n The condo needs a makeover, furniture is dirty, old and smells. We avoided sitting on the sofa the whole time we were there. One of the other guest had mentioned the screen door is broken six months ago, it is still broken allowing bugs to get in the condo. Bedroom closest to the street is terrible, you hear everything from outside so don't expect to get any sleep after 6 am. Same room bathroom tub doesn't drain properly, takes over 20 min to drain after shower. Bedroom two was ok for kids. We had bed bug bites the first night. Kitchen was ok for two days stay.\n\nWe had booked the place for three nights but left after the second night, the place needs makeover in bad way. \n\nVacasa who manages the place needs to go out and look at the place and compare with other reviews to see if the upkeep is being done.", "We stayed in 402 two years ago and that condo was amazing. This one could use a little updating. The furniture is stained and it has a musty smell to it but was still a great place.

The lady I spoke to assured me someone would be out immediately with current tags, but nobody ever showed up and we were a little nervous about the car being towed during our stay. We had no issues.

I'm talking about a 15 minute walk, which wouldn't be too bad! But the actual boardwalk with all the shops and restaurants is another 15-20 min walk along the beach.

Pfff!\n- The only means to cool the bedroom was a fan that was broken! \n- the bedroom furniture is severely outdated!

Want to get food?  Cross the street. It\u2019s a closer walk than some of the points of interest in the resort I work in. \n\nI can see during peak periods how congested this area can be; a quirk of its central location. \n\nTraveling to Ocean City, you will find this condo is very accessible via the northern entry into the area.  I can see how well this would fare should you choose to commute to OC. \n\nDid you want the beach instead? Walk in the direction opposite of the stores and services to find your beach is just as close as the store. \n\nNo more \u201clong walks\u201d from your fringe temporary hotel room or loading up in your rental just to fight  traffic and public parking. You are THERE when you arrive at the condo and can easily enjoy your entire trip without so much a glance at your car. \n\nFor accommodations, you will find a professionally cleaned condo and a full assortment of goods to enjoy a long stay if that\u2019s your preference. You can make your own meals and visit a local grocery to help while using the well-equipped kitchen.  A dishwasher is also built in to keep you from hand washing - increasing the amount of time you have to enjoy your rental. \n\nEveryone has rules and this unit is no exception. You may see as I did that the rules are there to ensure that everyone can enjoy a pleasant experience. You will find the instructions are clear and concise and very similar to how one would treat their own home. These rules protect the amenities that you and those in the future will enjoy. \n\nYou will enjoy that two full bathrooms are available, with the master suite housing a jacuzzi and shower. \n\nOne quirk was the heating/ac unit. I am certain that the problem will be resolved in the future; you kinda have to baby the system a bit until you reach the desired temperature.  A moderate repair would eliminate this quirk. \n\nYou will find the open concept very inviting. A kitchen bar with seating allows for options while a table and chairs is also available. You have plenty of space to relax in the living room, or visit your own balcony space with seating to just enjoy the sound of the ocean. \n\nBedrooms are in tune with the theme of the condo, with matching furnishings and a comfortable bed for master suite. We did not try the beds in the other bedroom, but the appearance was similar to the master. \n\nI hope you find this review helpful for my friends condo. He was so excited to obtain this property and enjoys the opportunity to make your stay the best possible for you. I believe you will find your stay quite acceptable and maybe even amazing, especially if this is your first time to visit the OC."], "ratings": [5, 5, 5, 5], "availability": "NNNNYYYNNNNNNNNNNYYYYNNNNNNNNYYY"},

There were a few things that needed attended to, but the important part is how the owners respond to it. Joan and Ben were wonderful at helping us take care of a few things. They even personally came to the apartment to make sure things were taken care of. Super sweet of them especially with all they had going on. The location is perfect for fun and sun. Within walking distance to Endless summer, coconuts bar, surf shops, ice cream and way more. I would recommend staying with Ben and Joan. You will enjoy your stay.", "The location is amazing! The unit is great, this was our second time staying here in less than a year. We will definitely return.", "First of all, you can't beat the location of this place. Steps from the beach, a nice convenient foot wash, and a parking place. Plus, if you are into partying, Coconuts is a 1 minute walk away. \n\nWe did have a few issues that could probably just be taken care of in a day or two. The bathroom exhaust fan didn't work and just had a kind of dirty vibe to it. The tub drain was clogged so I had to pull a bunch of hair (not mine) out of it. The bedroom smelled EXTREMELY musty. It was a little bothersome. One of the two kitchen outlets was also not working so we kept having to move countertop appliances back and forth but it wasn't a huge deal. Just a lot of small things. \n\nWifi was excellent, lots to choose from on the TV, and the kitchen did have everything we needed to cook meals. All in all, it was a nice experience with a couple of minor annoyances. This place would be 5 stars if the owner could make a few updates.\n\nWe did contact the owner mid-stay about a few things and left a voicemail but never heard back so that was a bit unfortunate. If you are the kind of people who rarely stay at the place and just hang at the beach all day, the place is perfect.", "Yes. You can walk to the beach. If we needed to get anything from the condo, I\u2019d be there and back on the beach in 5 minutes. You can walk to Dough Roller Pizza and Higgins Crabhouse in 10 mins or less. Responsive, kind host. Condo had beach chairs and an umbrella so we didn\u2019t have to rent! A nice perk!", "We had a wonderful stay at this property! You can\u2019t beat the location, literally steps from the beach! Being on the first floor and end unit was super convenient for unloading and packing back up and for coming in from the beach to wash up with a toddler. We also liked that the Coconuts restaraunt/bar was next door. We only got over there for one drink to bring out to the beach with us during our stay but it seemed like a fun atmosphere with very good live music. The unit was a good amount of space for the three of us and worked out having the futons(pretty comfy) in the living room as my daughter and I ended up sleeping out there a couple of nights when she was having a tough time sleeping. The only things I would note that could be improved are the cleanliness of the floors and an odor in the bedroom. I did a good scrub when we got there just to be sure bc the baby is constantly crawling and dropping things on the floor which then end up in the mouth and it seemed they could have been much cleaner to start. The bedroom odor was slightly musty I would say, not a huge deal but noticeable. The owners were very nice to deal with and it was an easy process to check in. Definitely would love to come back and stay here again!"], "ratings": [4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 5], "availability": "NNNNNNNYYNNNNNYYNNNYYYYNNNYYYYYY"},

The two top floor bathrooms are obviously leaking or have leaked down into the kitchen ceiling. There is a window on the top floor that is broken the whole length of it, tape is covering the crack and it won't shut so outside air is constantly coming in. If you want wifi on a floor besides the main floor, it's spotty. The location is good but the place is not taken care of and sheets were not provided for the sofa bed even though other beds had them and no pillow cases for the master bed.", "There's a ton of potential for this home, but overall it was a disappointment. When we first arrived, the air conditioning wasn't working (though customer service sent someone the next day to fix it). Only 1 of the 4 stovetop burners worked and the silverware was sparse to say the least (1 fork, serving spoons in place of dinner spoons). There was water damage in the ceiling of the kitchen, some of the blinds were broken, a window was broken and the washing machine was broken (and full of black water). There was also a ton of smudge marks and dirt everywhere. The place really could've used a good scrubbing and somebody with a screwdriver to tighten up doorknobs and such. Overall it was poorly maintained.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat said, the place was not a total disaster. We appreciated the customer service agency sending someone to fix the air conditioning. The location is hard to beat being right next to the beach and even has a covered parking spot designated to the home. There are three full baths and a full kitchen that would make it ideal for a family staying here. Again, it would be a fantastic place to stay if only they took better care of it.", "Convenient and roomy", "We stayed at the San Torino townhouse at the end of June. The location is amazing; literally a short walk to the beach. The house was a great size, kitchen had most of what we needed.... However the house is in great need of many repairs. Everything is broken- from floor tiles in every bathroom, the towel bars fall off the walls, Windows that won\u2019t close the whole way, kitchen faucet barely attached, visual evidence of water damage on ceiling, broken chair on balcony, screen door to upper balcony destroyed, blinds barely work on master bedroom sliding door. Smallest and most uncomfortable queen bed in the master.... ....it\u2019s a great home to stay in with kids, no fear of them hurting the perfect vacation home. I\u2019d stay again, I just want people to know this is very true to OCMD listings, pictures look great but house isn\u2019t quite as nice as the photos would lead you to believe. It was a great stay, we had a blast, but I\u2019m slightly worried about getting my security deposit back, I don\u2019t want to be blamed for any of the damage.....overall opinion - location is perfect. House size was perfect for our family of 4 - three full bathrooms were very appreciated. House condition is probably a 5 out of 10 which was a little stressful hoping nothing further broke on our watch.", "If you are only interested in being close to the beach, this is a great spot for you. Only minimal necessities were provided, including toilet paper and paper towels. There are 3 bathrooms and they only provided 3 rolls of toilet paper for a 5 day trip. There were no extra blankets or pillows in the house, including no blanket for the pull out sofa. The amenities list internet, but there is a note saying there is no wifi which caused confusion prior to us checking in. The house does have wifi so the description should be updated. The top floors air conditioning unit stopped working during our stay and it was fixed the next morning, however no accommodations were provided, such as fans, for a hot night. Overall, the place needs work. There was a broken chair on the top balcony, the kitchen sink faucet was loose, and the griddle on the stove did not work. There is a large water stain on the ceiling in the living room which must\u2019ve come from an upstairs bathroom where it feels like the floor could give in if you step too heavily. I was overall disappointed with the house, but again, it is just a short walk to be on the beach.", "I like the house. I was disappointed we had to wait until 4 to get in, but not really a problem. The television situation is confusing. Maybe try providing instructions on how to access the channels.", "I would give this four and a half stars, but you can't do halfs. Very nice beach rental, fantastic location a block (or less) to the beach. Surrounded by great restaurants, things to do (mini-golf, etc). It is in the Northern-most part of OC, so not walking distance to the boardwalk, but this was not an issue for us. Because it was off-season AND mid-pandemic, it was very quiet and peaceful; I don't know how true that is in full-season, but it was nice for us. The house was well-appointed, clean, easy communications with the agency - really everything was perfect. The one big thing, which was my fault, was that I did not realize that there is no wifi. Usually I always have that as a sine qua non in my search parameters, so I don't know how I missed it, but I didn't actually realize this until I had actually arrived and was trying to figure out how to get online. That was when I re-read and double-checked the listed amenities and realized that wifi was not listed. Disappointed but, again, my fault for missing that, not theirs.

I want to say upfront that I am so grateful to the owners and for the opportunity to stay there. It definitely met our needs, was perfectly located (we just wanted the beach and fishing) and it was SO spacious and cute! \n\nFor future renters: the location is incredible. There is a small view of the ocean, it is steps to the beach, and parking was ample. The apartment was equipped with everything but we brought our items anyway. When you stay here, Keep in mind that it is likely a high traffic area for other renters, lots of people coming and going each weekend, so dont let the atmosphere of the apartment throw you off. It obviously was cleaned, and smelled fresh. Visually, its clear that it is an older and highly used building. \nTips:\nBring your own blankets \nThe coffee shop across the street is currently drive-thru only \nBring house slippers\n\nPros: \nEverything we needed was available to us\nThe layout and location was excellent!! \nSpacious\nObviously cleaned and sanitized \nEasy access and felt safe\nLove the paintings! \n\nCons (suggestions for the owners)\n(caveat: I totally appreciate all that you do to maintain this location and thank you again for allowing us to stay)\nThe master bedroom needs a new comforter. \nThe dining table is really cool but consider new or repainting the chairs?\nThe coffee pot was missing from the machine\nI realize lots of salty beach people are going all over the living room carpet but consider a vinyl flooring and area rugs? Cheaper and easier to replace and the vinyl helps to prevent water damage to any floors. Otherwise, it might be time for a new carpet\nThe deck has a popped board near the top of the steps that could be dangerous if someone trips there, and falls down the steps. \nNow is the time for new furniture, its all mostly on sale. Consider grabbing a new sturdy plastic set? The current set has a lot of rust and loose paint on it and my 2 year old was trying to play with it. I know what those splinters feel like so please, for future families, consider changing them so that no one gets cut or injured. \nLastly, my father-in-law used the bed near the window in the first room and he said that he nearly fell off of it. He said that it was very wobbly and uneven so the first night, he didnt sleep too well. Possibly a new frame would help? Amazon has them for that size for under $100. \nOverall, I'm not a snobby person and I would definitely stay here again!!!", "This place may show some age, but it's location is wonderful.

But, just a couple of things that was a big deal to us. The condo could use some TLC. The electric in kitchen needs repaired, refrigerator leaks, the family room tv did not work and upstairs was very hot. So, we called the number that was given to us. NO ONE FROM THE PROPERTY MGMT EVER RETURNED OUR CALL. There is no instructions in the condo on who to contact. No listing of property mgmt or anything. We called Vrbo twice and they were so apologetic that we were not contacted. My husband spent 2 hours fixing the things that should have been done. Come to find out the ac upstairs was working, but what they forgot to mention was a mattress was placed underneath the actual bed blocking the air...the tv was wired wrong, the tv remote was missing, the lights flickered in kitchen and the refrigerator is just old. Could the condo use an update? Yes, but this was not a deal breaker. Cleanliness and convenience is what was important. The community pool was well maintained and clean. Overall our stay was pleasant, quiet and peaceful. Just disappointed that we had to waste a couple of hours of our vacation to make repairs and never received a call back.

Unit is very lovely and pictures are accurate (issues addressed below).\nNegatives: Aspects of bathrooms need some attention -- master bath sink not fully supported by precarious stilts (that look nice, but don't function well). Shower heads less than preferable. Shelf in hall bathroom not secured to wall well. Generally, not a lot of counter space to place your toiletries. Biggest issue...Vertical blinds in all rooms do not block incoming light at night well at all. They are cut to accommodate a built in desk in guest bedroom, so there are no curtains from floor up to about waist high (see bedroom pic with \"Relax\" wall hanging). We tried to stack sofa cushions and pillows up to block the light. Then we realized that curtains do not reach the ceiling in any room. At least a foot of space along the top where there are no curtains exist (see pic with kitchen table and master bedroom). There's a frosted window along the ceiling (perhaps in every unit?) with no curtain to block the light (in this unit). Since the property faces pool and welcome area, there is constant street light coming in at night. While beds were very comfortable, it was very difficult to get a good night sleep. It felt like 5:00 AM sunrise all night long. Curtains provide good privacy, yes, but light blocking, no. We suggest some ceiling to floor, wall to wall good solid curtains, which would be a wonderful addition to this property for owner to consider.

After we arrived on a Tuesday we noticed the master toilet did not flush, so I called in a service request. A vacasa maintenance man arrived to look at it and determined it was a broken handle and stated he would check his truck, if he had one he would fix it on the spot if not tomorrow morning. OK it's a two bathroom unit so no biggie, the next day came and went and no maintenance man no communication. Thursday morning we called vacasa to follow-up, and the operator told us her notes indicated maintenance was still trying to get a part and made a note for somebody to call me. Our trip has come to an end and as of departure, Saturday, no repair was made, no calls were returned for the toilet issue. Good thing it was not a single bathroom unit. The other issue was that parking passes were supposed to be left in the unit, I searched to no avail, I mentioned this to the operator when I called about the toilet and was told I was supposed to print them out according to her notes. I reviewed my email and re-stated the passes were supposed to be here (towing is expensive), she could not help me. I forwarded the email to info@vacasa.com and received a response on Wednesday that a pass would be dropped off, I also received a call that they wouldn't be able to make it (Wednesday night), but would drop it off Thursday morning, when we returned from the beach Thursday the pass was on the table. The actual property was quiet, a little musty and in need of some updating, the tube TV in the family room is not an old picture, it's still there. We knew what we in for as we had to cancel our original plans due to Covid, so having credit back from Vacasa was fortunate and since it's the 11th hour and this was the only place available. The ceiling fan blades in the MBR are loose, missing a few key elements in the kitchen (corkscrew- perhaps it grew legs). This is a great area of Ocean City, away from all the noise of Coastal Hwy and the board walk, being on the canal is really nice, sitting in the morning with coffee and evening with a cocktail.

Nice small kitchen to cook some breakfasts and a few dinners so we didn&#x2019;t have to eat out every night.  2 very short blocks to the beach and 1 block from the bay. We had problems with the door keypad but Dawn and another representative from Turnkey were very pleasant and accommodating, so were the phone representatives. Overall we had a good experience, aside from people up all hours of the night(on the last night of our stay) but that has nothing to do with the room obviously. It&#x2019;s a shore town, we expected it. I would certainly recommend the room here from turnkey vacations and would definitely consider booking it for our next trip to ocean city!", "This is a Senior Week House! Do not rent for adults or families. It's no wonder we were able to get early check in, the place was clearly not cleaned prior to us getting there and they clearly do not have a linen service, since they asked us to \"help them out and run a load of linens before we leave\". The entire place smelled musty and moldy as we walked in.. that is after you get past the bucket of cigarette butts at the front door for the office staff. The first thing we did was check for bed bugs (would not have been surprised if we found them), instead we were shocked to see dirty stinky sheets. The bed sheets in the double bed were not cleaned from the previous tenant, they smelled like someone's dirty hair, had hairs all over them and dirt down near the feet. We washed them right as we got there and were disappointed that the washing machine was not functioning properly. The washer was filthy inside, if you can imagine how that is possible, and the dryer takes forever to dry likely because the vent is not connected properly, there is no way any of the linens were washed at all. We called our family and told them to bring sheets so they didn't have to wash the other room or the extra set (that didn't fit the pull out bed-that is grossly stained). It felt like we were staying in a frat house, not up to expectations for a group of mature women coming to town to visit for a family party. Also, there was a paper towel covering one of the vents taped down, which is a hazard and not efficient. The office smelled like cigarettes. There was a smell of marijuana that kept seeping through the door and vents. The tubs cracks are filled with mold. The entire place needs to be updated. I don't have bad allergies normally, but they sure were severely acting up all weekend when we were in the home. The last evening, we were coming back from dinner and we heard the office security speaking to a drunk woman. We heard them say \"she went in that apartment\" so the drunk woman came up banging on our door at midnight, even tried to open the door to get in! Apparently she was looking for someone that pissed her off and security told her there she went in our apartment! Seriously! Most of the window locks did not work, the front door bolt didn't lock, so anyone with a code (office staff or crazy drunk lady) could get in, which was unnerving. Honestly, we left early as another night was unbearable. I would not recommend renting this place to adults, sadly!", "We had a great time!", "I would not recommend this property.It was very dirty .. The bathrooms were not clean the shower had soap scum in them \u2026Old pee stains on the toilet..

However it was very filthy and alot of things didn't work or broke. There's tvs in the bedrooms but only get a black screen. If you have kids bring your own media device. You know it's a bad sign when you see bed bugs and roach spray under the sink. We had to buy our own cleaning supplies and clean from top to bottom. The air conditioner in the back bedroom was ready to fall out of the window and we fixed that also. One of the bedrooms has a leak from the upstairs apt. If you use the closet your clothes will get wet. The only pro is the location. We only used a 1/4 tank of gas the whole week. We would recommend another place in the same area because this unit was not worth the money.", "Upon arrival we found that one of the a/c units was not there and the window was wide open. This caused the bedroom to feel like it was over 100 degrees. Called immediately and they did call me back and said that the owner removed it and they would see how they could fix it. They did send someone out later at night with two box fans which wasn\u2019t great but I really appreciated the effort. The next day they called and said the owner would authorize them to install a new a/c unit but inclined that it may take a couple days to get someone to measure the window then find a unit and install it. Was super excited that they actually had it all done by the afternoon. Again, very pleased with the \u201cturn key management\u201d team that handles the property. Next down fall was the cleanliness. There was a old cardboard bowl with food on it along with several solo shot glass party cups all over the deck. The company told me that the wind must have blown them over from the neighbors. I doubt that because there\u2019s hardly any wind in the front. The bathroom ceiling was cracked and falling apart. The bathroom door was smashed on the interior part like someone punched it. About 30% of the tiles throughout the house were cracked so we didn\u2019t want to walk barefoot and risk cutting our feet. The entire floor and front deck were filthy. The front deck was almost black from all of the bird poop and the railings were so covered in bird poop that you couldn\u2019t even rest your arms on it and look over. Definitely wasn\u2019t something that happened over a couple days. After the first night we had to go to the grocery store to get cleaning supplies to mop the floors and clean the counters. The other problem is the front door doesn\u2019t fit correctly. Every time you use the electronic lock to open or close the door you would have to use your other hand and pull the door into place so the lock would catch. We thought this would be a quiet community of condos because it said must be over 25 to rent. That\u2019s is for this unit only though and all the units are privately owned which we were unaware of. We ended up with about 6 kids next to us smoking pot on the balcony every night. About 15 kids in the unit below us doing the same. And the other unit below us was also littered with high school kids partying so hard police had to come evict them. Cable didn\u2019t work and clicked on the owners xfinity account and found out it was past due so probably cut off.", "This condo was the Perfect location, the pool is right next to to the condo and there is parking on the small road beside the condo.

The location of this property is wonderful! You don't have to cross Coastal which is a huge plus for us with children. The walk to the beach is a short walk and the beach in front of the dune crossing didn't get overly crowded like you would get in front of a large hotel. You hear noise from the street at night but we had a sound machine to help with that. If you're in the rooms on the bottom floor you will also hear every footstep in the living room. We were surprised that the rooms were much larger than we were expecting. Pictures generally make places look larger than they really are, but not these. The pictures were accurate or even showed the rooms as smaller! We had plenty of space for all of us. The kitchen also has a lot of counter space and the pots, pans, and other appliances provided were just what we needed for our stay. The balconies are on the smaller side. We like to sit out and play games at night but you can really only comfortably fit 3-4 chairs out on the deck at 1 time. Other places in the area have much larger \"decks\". This was definitely balcony size. The couches are awful. Pretty sure they were broken (not by us!).

Most of the condos don\u2019t rent, and those that do tend to be small and/or dated.\n\nImagine That! solves all those problems. Spacious, filled with light, quality finishes and furniture, and so thoughtfully planned. Between us and our friends visiting from across the street, we often had 6 adults and 3 kids under six in the space. There was plenty of room for cooking, playing, relaxing, and then some!\n\nIt seems small, but the organization alone makes it clear a family designed this space. It\u2019s not a flipper or developer grabbing cash. Storage and hooks for days! So many places to put all the things tiny humans drag with them on vacation.\n\nThe view is phenomenal. One of my favorite things to do was just quietly sit on the couch or balcony at golden hour and watch the sun over the dunes.\n\nQuality tech too! The large LG TVs all around were much appreciated. We also have LGs at home and I\u2019m convinced they have the best picture. Alexa was a fun novelty, but we really only used her to control the shades.\n\nLast that not least, being able to easily go downstairs for a pool day when the kids weren\u2019t in a beach mood was incredibly convenient. I wasn\u2019t sure about the pool size from the photo, but it\u2019s a normal size pool that goes up to 5 feet.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing something, but the property was fantastic and we will be booking again next year. And probably every year until we purchase our own.", "We love this section of OCMD, and we were thrilled to be able to stay at such an awesome property so close to the beach. We had three families with young kids, and it worked out perfectly for us. The host was very quick to respond to any and all questions, and made things very easy. We are already looking forward to booking again in 2022!", "We had an amazing experience at this gorgeous condo! It was beautifully decorated, clean, and well equipped for our two families. Located was perfect and a quick walk to the beach. It was so nice having beach chairs, umbrella, cart and toys provided at the condo. Stephen was so helpful and accommodating. We also loved the \u201cwelcome\u201d note and goodies. So very generous! Thank you!", "We had such a great stay.

At the home you will find a very nice kitchen with all of the comforts of home (plus a few extra fancy features), really strong WiFi (we had more than 10 devices running at good speed), very nice smart TV\u2019s preloaded with Netflix and Prime / USB chargers throughout / Alexa powered home, awesome bathrooms (especially the master) with good water pressure, and lots of space for your family to spread out. Very nice pool. Covered private parking, secure building access and good elevator. Building is very well maintained. \n\nOwners were a pleasure to deal with from beginning to end. Very kind, helpful and generous. We were welcomed by a really nice gift bag from them that had some necessities, snacks, wine and a couple of souvenirs in a cute beach bag. They are definitely focused on making sure it\u2019s a wonderful experience and made themselves available for any concern with prompt response. \n\nHonestly the home is so lovely it\u2019s hard to believe they rent it out.", "Came with with colleagues for conference and extended stay to enjoy time with additional friends and family.

Great people and dolphin watching from the balcony. Perfect location across from north side park.", "We had a fantastic time at this property, and highly recommend. The decor and furnishings are gorgeous. From the balcony you have a wonderful ocean view, and plenty of seating for everyone to sit and enjoy the view. My family of teenagers were thrilled with all the tech amenities, and this mom was thrilled with the many little luxuries throughout. A super easy walk to the beach. The owners were very reachable and accommodating.", "Imagine That was perfect! Great location and the place was very clean, new, quiet, well decorated and spacious! We can't wait to go back!", "This home, located in North Ocean City, is one of the nicest homes we have ever stayed in. The owners were a dream to work with and ensured every aspect of our stay was taken care of. \n\nThe appointments in the home were superb! Furniture was new, comfortable and clean. The kitchen was well supplied and ensured we didn't have to bring much with us besides our food. Our family LOVED the voice controlled shades - and the \"kids bunk room\" was a hit with the little ones who made a fort on the lower bunk to sleep! \n\nAs a maid service owner, I can assure you this home was CLEAN and SANITZED! There were instructions in each room on how to operate the TV and having ability to use our Neflix, Hulu and Amazon accounts was great - especially with the kids. \n\nDid I mention that this place is huge? There were 11 of us, ages ranging from 2 to well, old. There was plenty of room and the wrap around deck with its furniture was perfect to enjoy the ocean and sunsets! Its a short walk to the beach and also had a nice pool for the kids to enjoy. \n\nWe will refer our friends to Imagine That! and rent this place again for a family vacation!

There were tiny ants crawling around everywhere, on counters, stove, microwave and on the floor. Again, not what I had in mind. Additionally, the arch way that connects the \"dinning area\" to the living room/kitchen area leaks.

The location of the place was great, close to the beach, boardwalk, restaurants, and the OC Banana boat ride.

Neefs a renovation desperately.", "This property was ideal for ocean views! The balcony and master suite were large and great to sit on and enjoy the ocean air! Our sliding glass door to the balcony did not work properly and blew off during a storm, so that was a negative. But, overall a nice place!", "The condo was great, but the condo wasn't clean! The bathrooms were filthy, didn't look like it had been cleaned at all. The carpets weren't vacuumed. The sheets had a weird smell, like they weren't washed. The mirrors and glass tables were all smeared. The beds were uncomfortable, as they were hard as rocks. It said in description that the doors for the washer and dryer was supposed to be fixed last year, but still no doors. When I used Clorox wipes to wipe things down (since covid that's what I do when in a new place) the wipe was black. I would suggest that that the owners get new cleaners. I clean houses for a living and I can't believe they thought that was clean! \nThe location and the staff was good and the pool was clean. I would stay again but maybe in another condo or if the owners would make sure they are getting what people are paying for. \nOh, I forgot, I hand washed everything I used so\nI didn't think to look in the dishwasher until the.morning I left. It was filled.woth dishes that didn't look clean all the way. I didn't know it was my responsibility to empty and rewash someone's else's dishes, the cleaning service should have done that.", "Our family of 4 stayed at the Irene. It\u2019s undergoing renovation in the front but it looks like it will be nice. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n The good: the place was nicer than the pictures. Everything was clean and comfortable. The grandparents stayed in another unit with another rental company and our\u2019s was much nicer, cleaner and better stocked kitchen. The view can\u2019t be beat! The beach is out the door which made coming and going simple. Even better\u2014the storage closet off the bay side balcony was stocked w chairs and a few toys. Wish we knew about that before we lugged all our chairs to MD. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bad: beds were kind of hard. If you want extra blankets bring your own. The ceiling fans don\u2019t have much power. The microwave wasn\u2019t working. We had maintenance come by within a day of calling but they couldn\u2019t fix it. We didn\u2019t get a replacement but managed. The curtains in the main room were ripped but we kept them open so you couldn\u2019t tell. The long blinds in master were broken and the sunrise at 6am WILL wake you up. Maintenance did what they could to make it better but the whole thing needs to be replaced.

However, all of the issues that were pointed out in the prior reviews that the manager responses said were resolved, were not. Specifically, as mentioned, the carpet has stains, the blinds are broken, one of the dining room chairs is broken and there's a mirror missing from one of the closet doors as soon as you come into the condo. I would not have rented this home if I didn't read that all of these issues had been corrected and it is not right for the management to state that they have resolved when they haven't.", "Unfortunately, this otherwise nice property was in disrepair upon my arrival. Apparently, this has been the case for quite some time from the reviews I have read. I hoped with the passage of time, those items would have been taken care of before I rented the unit. The living room curtains were tattered and wouldn't close for privacy. Master bedroom vertical blinds had more missing than present leaving no privacy at all as well as sun blasting in your face in the morning. Black mold found in the second bathroom around the HVAC vent. Main living area carpet was filthy with a multitude of stains. A missing mirror and another broken mirror door in laundry area. Kitchen cabinet above sink needs hardware adjustment as it doesn't close properly. Refrigerator froze all my fresh produce. No K-cup coffee maker as most other rentals have. Smelled cigarette smoke in both bathrooms throughout the week. Deck screen door had no inside handle so that you could go out on the deck. All windows leaked cold air in, curtains were moving with the breeze coming in from outside. Cracked walls need repair and the entire place needs to be painted. This could be a nice unit with some serious repairs and regular maintenance.", "The location on the beach can't be beat and we love the Irene; we've been there several times. We read the negative reviews about maintenance issues when we booked this unit 1/2 a year before our stay. We assumed that issues like missing blinds in the bedroom and broken mirrors would have been addressed. We loved the idea of watching the sunrise over the ocean from the balcony. The reality was we got to see it every morning from the bed, no escaping it.

The kitchen was well equipped with cooking utensils but I always travel with my own crock pot and large fry pan and griddle. I never like the pots and pans as previous renters don't clean or take care them. Be sure to close the refrigerator door as it needs adjusted. There is limited space to store groceries. We like to cook so the kitchen was nice enough. \nThe dining room is close quarters since space is limited, but doable. Chairs need felt on bottom of legs to make them slide easier.\n\nThe view from the living room was amazing and having the tennis courts and playground just below the balcony was perfect to watch our guys play. \n\nWe had a great week. god provided us with beautiful weather. If you are a front row person on the beach be prepared to get up at 5 AM to go place your chairs and umbrellas or you will lose the option and take a back row seat. Even getting the front row does not guarantee your spot because people don't care and will set up in front of you. If you don't like crowds this is not the beach for you. We literally sat elbow to elbow with people. \n\nThe beds were comfortable but don't try to utilize the bunk beds for adults. There is not enough head room getting into them, the beds are built to close together. \n\nAndrea was very accommodating and took care of our needs. There was a mix up with the linens but it was handled right away. Be sure to bring your own kitchen towels, dish mat (there was not a dish drainer) and dish cloths as none were provided by the owner or linen company. \n\nThe laundry/storage area was nice but very unorganized no doubt by previous guests.

The problems we encountered was with the unit maintenance. There were 2 showers in the unit- one in the master bath pulling from the wall and could not be changed to another setting- fine mist only. The second bath had a tub/ shower combo- the water continued to flow from the tub area as a shower was taken- causing standing water of 3 inches while showering. The bifold door was missing that covered the hot water heater/furnace creating a safety issue- especially if there were small children in your group. The screen door from the deck glass door was missing- standing beside the door. The blinds on the glass deck door  and master bedroom had missing panels- privacy was an issue. The handle to the glass door needed a simple screw driver to reattach- was very loose. We called maintenance to report the above concerns- had a million excuses why the unit looked like it did- which did not help with the situation. He was able to turn the master bath shower to another position- shower head still hanging from the wall, cleaned the drain in second bath- still drained from shower and bath head but no standing water. Could not fix blinds, bifold door or even the glass door screw. Very disappointing as the pictures on website were perfect.

I thought the fees associated with it were too high for what you got... So, a significant cleaning/housekeeping fee, but you had to supply your own cleaning materials (there were some left by previous renters) and expected to clean prior to leaving. No toiletries provided (including toilet paper)... not sure what the fee is covering. also a significant linen fee, but no towels provided, no extra linens provided either and was told to leave everything on beds intact prior to leaving... again, seems REALLY HIGH. For a 2 night stay, these fees that you didn't get much for added an 30% to the cost. Parking is an issue, also, but that's not unique to this place... it's an issue in OC in the summer across the board. For a very large group, it worked out, but honestly, the extra fees bother me a bit. I would definitely not stay here in the off season due to the fees.", "Issues with people parking in front of our garage.

It was nice to go onto the LARGE balcony and see/hear the ocean. Walking to the beach was a breeze being so close! There is a foot cleaning area under the deck, just watch your head! 2 side notes: We did find a good bit of dust behind the furniture, under the beds and in the corners of the closets, as well as sand on most of the throw carpets. Normally this is not of any concern and \"normal\" in rentals we just have to check closely due to a childs' dust allergy (he was not bothered by it). Also, the \"den\" bedroom does not have a traditional closing door, it is a slatted folding door so it can become noisy if people are in the living room so whomever sleeps there should not expect total silence. Again, you are on vacation and these are not concerns, just FYI's.

It is listed as a nonsmoking rental. When we arrived at the place it smelled badly of cigarette smoke, as if this was a place that was smoked in constantly. We contacted the contact person we were given, and she responded immediately. She said when she came to clean the place for our arrival, she notified the owner of the cigarette smell. He did not tell her to do anything differently than she was already doing. She stated that this was not the first time she had informed him about the cigarette smell. We then contacted Evolve because they were the ones that emailed us with confirmation and instructions for the rental. We contacted them via email and told them what we were experiencing and that we had contact the contact person. They replied to our email and told us to contact the contact person, which we had already done. We replied to their email telling them so, and asked for a refund. At this point my husband and daughter were both coughing from the smell. We did not hear back from Evolve. At this point we tried to find a hotel in the area, but they were all booked. We packed up our stuff and drove back home. The next day, 5/29, I contacted VRBO to tell them what happened and to ask for a refund. One agent documented the issue and gave me a case number. During the call we were disconnected but she called me back and escalated the issue to the department that issues refunds. I then had to detail the whole issue again with a new person. He then put me on hold for 45 minutes and said he was contacting Evolve. At one point he asked me for proof that the place smelled like cigarette smoke. After 45 minutes the call was disconnected and he never called me back. So I have not heard from Evolve or VRBO. If you want a nonsmoking rental, do not rent this place. It is gross and you cannot breathe inside of it. I will think twice before using this service again. I have rented via VRBO for years and this kind of customer service is unacceptable.

We enjoyed our stay very much!\n\nThe hosts were very responsive, even getting the AC fixed while we were out one day. \n\nSome notes for anyone else bringing babies or small children. There are 2 step stools under the sink in the hallway bathroom, which are helpful for the kids. Our youngest is crawling a lot so we brought some tension baby gates, but the hallways are just a tad too wide for them. So don't waste space in your car with baby gates. :) It was nice to have a high chair there, but FYI it is a restaurant-style wooden one, without a tray. The three pools that you have access to in the community are a lap pool, a \"family\" pool, and a baby pool. Unfortunately any kid in diapers is not allowed in the lap pool or the family pool. So if you have multiple kids and one of them is in diapers, you'll need to split up and have one stay with the baby in the baby pool, and the other in the family pool, or all crash the baby pool if there's only one adult. The bathrooms at the pool didn't have any baby changing tables that I saw. So be prepared for changing a baby poolside if needed, as there isn't even counter space in the bathrooms at the pool. \n\nOur son really enjoyed catching crabs right off the dock outside the back deck of the condo. Other fun events included music and fireworks at the park just up the road, going to the boardwalk, mini golf, and getting to pet a baby kangaroo - Barn Hill Preserve brings them around to businesses and takes a $10 donation to help support their work during the school year with elementary kids."], "ratings": [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], "availability": "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN"},

However, the condition of the property was terrible. The property owner (who cleans it himself) was not receptive of our concerns at all & rather began to yell at me when I was pointing them out. We came into the house & immediately noticed the smell. From appearance during our walk through, most things looked okay. Once he left, we began to check the beds & put on our sheets. We realized this was where the smell was coming from. The quilts & the top layer of the 2 mattress protectors were pretty gross. We started to pull the quilts off. The beds also had padded mattress protectors (over normal ones) that were stained and full of sand. After discussing our options, we asked the owner to come look at them & to possibly bring clean ones as these were due for a wash. He informed us that we should expect sand at the beach, and they don't wash them just as hotels do not, (which I understand is true to a point). However, good hotels would never use that style of mattress protector, and things are washed when they smell bad and replaced when they are stained. We also asked him to go ahead and take the rug from the living room, because it was rolling up on 3 of the 4 corners. He had originally told us to move it if we'd like to keep the kids from falling, & he was planning to replace it during our stay. When he moved the coffee table, there was popcorn, chips, skittles, & soooo much more sand under the coffee table. We did not find another property available on short notice to fit our group size, so I started cleaning myself. We bought new mattress protectors for each bed, new pillows as those also smelled, and we had already brought our own sheets. The vacuum wasn't working well enough to pick up sand, but with the broom I swept under the beds, couches, where the rug had been, ect. I found items left by prior renters in Every Single Room (used deodorant, perfume, dirty socks, hair ties, ping pong balls, & food), so nothing had been cleaned well at all. I took photos with the intent on posting during my review, but I realize I cannot. I also would like to mention that there are a few items in need of repair as well. The only normal sized burner on the stove is broken, the safety rail on the bunk bed is broken and half is completely detached, and the bottom shelf of the refrigerator is broken and squishes the drawer below.

Otherwise, great property and would stay here again.", "It was nice to have the beach at the end of the block, without crossing the road and be in a quiet neighborhood. Less foot traffic, noise and larger beach area accessible for ability to social distance.

Will definitely use her Condo again.", "We thought the location was close enough to the good restaurants but far enough away from the Boardwalk crowd.

The condo was very well taken care of and nice! Stylish and quality! We did go buy another tv because the kids needed a tv in their room since he was in his room alot but next time I would just bring one. We had a great time playing boardgames at the big table and swimming. I would stay there again!", "A wonderful condo filled with good appliances, cable TV, and Wi-fi. Large rooms with comfortable beds and furniture, A balcony to lounge on. A spacious pool and area to relax when not at the beach which is just a short walk away.

Our family has been going there for 4 years and plan to visit again inthe upcoming years. \nLouiza is always a wonderful hostess!!", "Our family rented this condo for the Easter holiday and we couldn't be happier with our choice.

Quiet neighborhood, not too crowded, and best of all just steps to ocean and many restaurants. Highly recommend.", "It was our first time booking online and also a last minute one. Owner was fantastic in helping us navigate through the process. The place was beautiful and comfortable, and we all loved it. Even though it was off season, there was still plenty to do for the kids and adults. The beach was just a short walk from the condo, unfortunately for us it was too cold to swim.

Contacted him and was told how to lock a sliding door that is not a common door lock? Told to unplug and plug the tv back in which still didn\u2019t work my whole stay. And never sent anyone to check on the refrigerator which I was told to just turn it up!! No more response and no repair person came!! For the money charged I expected at least a little common courtesy and sending a maintenance person. But I was told if I lost the key they had tired to a rip plastic bag it would cost me $75 for him to come out and unlock the door he had red taped on unlock already!!!

You can tell they have been working on updating the property, and the new mattresses were very comfortable.", "Small issue with missing key at check-in was quickly resolved by Isaac who was very responsive.

The owner is very accessible and responds almost immediately to any request via text or email. \n \nPROS:\nLocation! Location! Location! You are literally a five minute walk to the beach and to the 30th Street Jolly Roger Amusement/Water Park. The start of the boardwalk is also only 3 blocks away and the N/S Coastal Highway bus (for $3 ride all day) has bus stops within a three minute walk. Hint-you need exact change for the beach bus so bring single dollar bills. There is also a really good (but expensive) Minit Market which is about a seven/eight minute walk from the house. This is the closest to grocery shopping at the beach area I could find. There is no shortage of restaurants and mini golf- all within walking distance.\n\n-The washing machine and dryer were so great to have in the condo itself and were very easy to use.\n\n- Updated kitchen with a big fridge, oven, new microwave and double sink. Note: there is a drip coffee maker (no Keurig, but they're bad for the environment anyway). It works just fine. \n\n-very tastefully decorated!!\n\n-comfortable front porch for reading a book. \n\n-programmable front door lock was awesome. No keys and you get to program your own key code.\n\n-outdoor shower to wash off your sand and a clothes line to hang up your bathing suits and towels.\n\nCONS:\n- you have to bring your own sheets and towels due to Covid. \n \n-The wifi is spotty. Sometimes we would get a good signal; other days not so much.\n\n-Parking is at a premium on the weekend when you arrive as well as during the day time during high season. Suggestion-park your car and walk/bus to everywhere. \n\n-The floors are thin. This may not bother some people, especially if you have a quiet family above you, but if not, it can be extremely annoying. Unfortunately, we had a family with three small children above us who would run around during the day and late into the evening. Both the owner and I talked to the family. By mid week it was quiet by 11:30 pm or so; nevertheless please keep this in mind if your are sensitive to stomping noises. \n\nOverall it's a great property. If location is important to you and/or you have a big family/ group of friends (thus splitting the cost), this place is definitely for you. \n\nThank you for sharing your condo with us!

There is plenty of communal space in the living room, dining area, and the three season room (including its arcade games!). The house is stocked with paper towels, TP, and dish/laundry soaps. We did notice a couple things when we arrived at the home, but the owner, David, was super responsive in communicating what he would do to remedy the issues. He was honest and open, which I appreciated. The only issue with any impact on our stay was having ants in the kitchen from the window above the counter due to the flower box outside, so we didn't really have a chance to use the kitchen other than storing everything in the fridge and making coffee in the morning (from the stock of K-cups available!). However, David responded right away and also checked in about the issue via the Vrbo app during our stay. I certainly would stay here again - David was a responsive, honest host and the home is lovely with a great location.", "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this property. We had a chance to meet the owner prior to check-in and he was very pleasant and willing to help. He let my BF have his surfboard delivered to the property, and even put it in the sunroom for us, which was extremely generous and helpful. The space and grounds was absolutely perfect. Well-equipped, maintained and had everything we needed. The arcade barrel in the sunroom was the icing on the cake for me. I love playing Ms. Pac Man! lol Property was spacious enough to hold all 5 of us and we had more than enough space. Wish we had more time there so we could have spent more time in the backyard. Went out there a few times and it was peaceful and overlooked the canal. We will definitely stay here again and look forward to our next visit.", "Stayed here Thursday - Sunday in July. Overall it is a nice place with a good layout between living room, dining room, sunroom and deck. We had a minor issue arise and David quickly had it resolved. Would recommend to any small groups and families.", "This was the perfect place! We loved the location and the house is spacious and comfortable for sure. We brought our own paper products but we shouldn\u2019t have because the house was very well stocked. I would absolutely recommend this house. The owner was very responsive and communicated well. Thank you for the awesome vacation!", "We had a great time. First time stay in ocean city, everything is near by. I would recommend this place.", "I booked this last minute for a holiday weekend and everything about this property exceeded my expectations. I traveled with family including a group of teen boys. The location was perfect, near everything and yet in a quiet part of town. The house was perfectly equipped with anything you may need (or had forgot to pack) for a beach vacation. The host was incredibly thoughtful and I would definitely seek out this property to stay in again. 5+ stars!", "Nice property, nice location, the cleaning though was not that good, refrigerator was very dirty, and there was dogs pee in one of the bedrooms.\nJust need a new house keeping.\nOverall, I would still recommend the property."], "ratings": [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4], "availability": "NNNNNNNNNNNNNYNNNNYYYNNNYYYYYYYY"},

Bedrooms upstairs lacked curtains or blinds which was inconvenient to always change in the bathroom upstairs. The main floor did not have any blinds so you felt like you were in a fishbowl at night.

When we arrived we noticed the furniture was different and the place looked beat-up. We joked and said \"we are only here to sleep right?\" We checked out our beds which were not made with proper sheets, a flat sheet tucked in as a fitted sheet? After trying out the beds we were totally disappointed that every bed was super uncomfortable and had springs popping through. One of the beds had 2 dead bugs in it and a used band aid. Another bed had sand underneath the sheets....we were totally grossed out. We immediately ran to TJ MAXX and bought our own sheets, pillows and blankets. There were only four towels for the entire house. The carpets were stained and distrusting. The loft couch had a sheet over it to cover up the nasty couch underneath. There were no knives to cut things in the kitchen and we had to re-wash al the utensils. \nI wish I had better things to say because the house has a ton of potential and needs some TLC!", "Right before our vacation we saw negative comments that scared us. I called the company and they explained that everything was fixed/ replaced. However when we arrived, we noticed the cabinet door in the kitchen was not fixed, pots and pans were in terrible shape and the stairs need to be fixed. I emailed the woman I spoke with before our trip. She was very accommodating and explained that repairs would take place after we left but she personally dropped off new pots and pans. They didn\u2019t have a broom and the vacuum didn\u2019t work but the following day she dropped off a new broom and dust pan. The Air conditioning was our main concern but it worked great. The hot water worked well enough for 10 people to shower back to back without running out. The box springs were extremely noisy but the beds themselves were not uncomfortable. Some dressers were not functional/ broken. Furniture in the house was as pictured just moved around and some rugs were newer than pictured. The house is in a good location a few blocks from the beach, close to main stores and even a playground. I do recommend some small repairs to the home ie. the stairs and a working vacuum.

The same bathroom had a tub with peeling enamel.  Vacasa provides a courtesy bag with toilet paper, garbage bags, etc. but there was no hand soap anywhere in the property or the courtesy bag.

The closet is big and a set of draws for folded clothes or personal items would be great, I had to live out of a suitcase for five days. The bedroom with the twin beds also has a big closet but no draws. Also no mirrors in these rooms, no full size mirror in the house. A tv would have been nice in the queen size room but not necessary. You gave us a list of items to bring, please also note for families with small children to bring a safety gate for the steps. Also the tv programs do not have children shows PBS is only on in the am. Bring Videos. Make sure to bring toilet paper because bathrooms do not have any upon arrival. We paid a cleaning fee yet the renter is responsible to make the beds, take out the garbage to the townhouse bin, clean, dry and put away dishes etc. We also had to purchase damage insurance in addition to paying a damage deposit.\nAs I said earlier the townhouse is beautiful and very well maintained.

The lay-out of the condo was great and the location was only 1 block from the beach, with a small grocery store and excellent Jewish deli right across the street. Also, having elevator access, a pool (although it was too cold to go in because of the cool weather) and a washer and dryer were added bonuses. There were several small issues- ice cube maker wasn't working, about 5 lights were burnt out, the screen door to the balcony was difficult to manage, and the street noises were easily heard from the master bedroom- but with some earplugs and bags of ice from the store across the street, we weren't inconvenienced too much, and we didn't feel that notifying the property manager and waiting around for service was necessary. Would definitely recommend this place to others, but hope these relatively small issues would be fixed before coming back (did see these complaints in previous reviews, so they obviously were not addressed by management).", "The actual condo was nice. Great location and room to spread out. 3 bedrooms with decent beds, 2 full bathrooms. Nice balcony, but unfortunately we had very loud neighbors all hours of the night & could be easily heard when we were inside through the slider doors. The thin doors also don't help with constant traffic/city noise. This is to be expected in OCMD. The neighbors were sitting on their balcony continuously smoking so it made it unpleasant for us to sit outside. This has nothing to do with the condo itself, but it clearly states no smoking on the premises, along with noise ordinance enforced from 10pm-8am, which clearly was not.\n\nOverall, the condo itself is great. There were some issues with several of the lamps not working, broken bathroom door handle, coffee maker, ice maker in frig. not working, etc. There is a nice washer & dryer, lots of counter space & well stocked kitchen. \n\n\nMy issue is mostly with Vacasa, the management company used to handle the property. There were no additional linens for the beds, or towels, as stated. We had 6 guest on our reservation & only received towels for 4. It also stated cleaning supplies & paper products would be provided, but none were. These are not normally provided, but why state this in the description, if not correct? This was taken directly from the site - \"Finally, guests can simply arrive and relax, since we provide every home with starter amenities like hair and body care products, cleaning supplies (where permitted by law), and additional stock of basic household items like paper towels, toilet paper, a new sponge, dishwashing soap, and laundry detergent.\"\n\nWe stay in OCMD every year, we've had worse & better places that we have stayed. \n", "Great property with space.

The 2 bedrooms easily accommodated the 5 of us, the girls slept in the 2 double beds in the master bedroom and I took the smaller kids' room that had two single beds. The beds and pillows were comfortable. There are 2 full bathrooms with good water pressure. The storage space for clothing in the closets and dressers was good. Sunlight flooded in fron the many windows and glass doors. The LR sofas were extremely comfortable and there was a lot of space to move around yet still be together in the open Living/Dining/Kitchen area.

The kitchen will be updated soon but at the moment it has a darling, lived in feel that reminded the girls of their Maternal Gramma which pleased me!

There were 2 coffee makers and filters: a single cup and also a 10 cup pot. The toaster oven came in handy! We were grateful for the starter toilet paper, paper towels, napkins and facial tissues. The closets had balls, tennis racquets, beach chairs and so much more. The indoor heated pool was great when we were not at the ocean. Beach access was conveniently located from the 2nd floor. All throughout the apartment, we felt the love of familia, and it was a very nice place and a nice time. Seemed like too many photos of the LR though, on the Vrbo website. \nConnie, you are a great hostess! Thank you so much for thinking of everything.", "Connie was fantastic! The condo was perfect.

We had a wonderful week and hope to be back next year!", "This was our first time staying in Sunset Island and this was by far our favorite rental! The unit was very big, bigger than expected, and the location was perfect. Everything on Sunset Island was very walkable. We felt like the small beach near the unit was our own private beach. The pool was awesome, although we wished it would have opened earlier (opens at 11:30am for renters, owners can get in at 11am). But you can go to the bayside beach right next to the pool anytime. The service at the pool was great and we at lunch there and prices were reasonable. Everyone on the island was friendly (a lot of owners present) and our kids made friends for the week at the pool and played at the sunset location on the property in the evenings. There were events and plenty to do there. I also was able to get my coffee in the mornings at the market on premises and I was shocked no lines! We also hit up the market for ice cream in the evenings (open until 9pm). Mary was a gracious host and the unit had all the comforts of home. \nThis didn't feel like a worn out rental, but felt like guests in someone's well-cared for home. We really liked the keypad lock, we didn't need to carry keys with us. We pretty much stayed on the property and didn't have a need to go to the ocean, the bayside provided what we needed. I highly recommend this unit and I consider myself a \"local\" because I grew up with a beach house in OC (and worked in OC in the summer times), plus I still have family that lives in OC year round. This place is awesome for families with kids.", "The unit was immaculate. Clean, great view and very enjoyable.", "I stay at the property for over a month. Loved everything about it.", "We had a lovely time at our beloved Sunset Island, OCMD. The size of the refrigerator, amount of drawer space, and twin beds were the highlight.

We appreciated the TVs in every room (despite a lot of technical difficulties) as well as the decor and a different master bedroom quilt than is pictured.

Trash was not taken out, hair was in the tubs, and there appeared to be urine stains on a toilet. \n\nThe beds were without linens. The towels had not been replenished. There was a large pile of dirty laundry in the garage that had not been removed. \n\nMultiple communications with local managers ensued but we were made to feel like our concerns were and inconvenience and excuses were given instead of apologies. A manager did come in late that night to \u201cclean\u201d but obviously did a quick job, left dirty cleaning towels, and took our can of Lysol.

Could\u2019ve been cleaned better before our arrival.", "The property was spacious, functional, close and walk able to the beach and other shops/restaurants (i.e. Dunkin Donuts, Macky's Bayside Grill, Fager's Island, Seacrets, Sunsations, mini-golf, etc.). It was also right off of I-90, which made it convenient to get to by bypassing a lot of traffic. The owner was responsive and friendly - even let us check-in early and provided us with the option to use the garage (fits two cars) while the property was being cleaned. However, there was no access to the garage from the back where it was located, which was inconvenient. The garage door needed to be opened/closed from the inside. Additionally, as mentioned in a previous review, the property could be better in regards to cleanliness, provided amenities, and overall maintenance. The garage floor was covered in sand, which made it extremely slippery as we were loading and unloading. The 1st floor bathroom toilet was loose - there were even some loose screws laying around. Sheets, towels and walls did not seem to be 100% cleaned, which made it extremely uncomfortable for the guests. The coffee maker was also disgusting and didn't seem to be cleaned...ever! I would recommend bringing your own bath towels, as well as paper towels, toilet paper, dish and hand soap (dish soap provided was actually hand sanitizer). Much of it was provided initially, but not a lot to last our whole trip (should be more clear in listing). So, if a clean property is important to you, I wouldn't recommend this house. But if you can sacrifice that for location and space, then this could be for you!", "This place was NOT as clean as I would expect for the amount of $ spent. I have stayed in a lot of other beach houses that were significantly cleaner. There was mold in master shower, dirty dishes in cupboards, filthy silverware drawer- had to wash all silverware and the holder before we used it. Blood stains on pillow. No garbage can in the main bathroom, hand soap only in the basement bathroom. I found a pill capsule in the closet of bunkbed room... where the kids were staying. Obviously wasn\u2019t vacuumed. Headphones and debris under the bed, not sure how that could have been missed if it was cleaned. A pile of dirt between fridge and wall. There is not a good variety of kitchen utensils- if you plan on cooking a big meal, I would suggest bringing some basics- ladle, tongs, serving spoons. Few serving dishes available. We could not find extra towels and washcloths... until two days in to our trip when we found them still soaking wet in the dryer. Furniture has seen better days, none of the adults thought their bed was comfortable. There were plenty of games but most of them missing numerous pieces. \nThe garage is a great feature, big enough for two cars- however there is no remote to close or open it- so you either have to have someone open it for you from the inside or park out front and run down and open it, then get back in your car and drive around. To close it, you have to jump over the sensor while it is closing. \nThe balconies were nice, can see a sliver of the bay and a little of the ocean to the right. It is very close to the beach, easy to get to. Lots of grocery stores and restaurants nearby. It is about 30-35 blocks from the boardwalk- which we liked! Close to Jolly Rogers and mini golf as well. \nIf I was in college, this would be the perfect home because none of these things would have bothered me. However, I expected a lot more at my age now. \nIf the owners got a new cleaning crew, I think it would have been a great stay. However when you find new things every day that are subpar, it is frustrating. \nPictures look great, however looks can be deceiving.", "Once property cleaned at 5:30 p.m., all was well. Suggest renting information include that renters must provide toilet paper, napkins, paper towels, extra bath towels, soaps, etc. Lots of dishses/glasses/cups/silverware, etc. Owner should have broom and dust pan and brush available for renters to keep sand off floors. \n\nAt the Route 90 entrance; easy access to the beach; lots of restaurants and stores in the immediate area.

Going to the beach is so easy, if you forget something just walk back to the condo and get it. The beach is literally 30 seconds away walking distance. You can hear the ocean and enjoy your coffee in the balcony. My family and friends cooked every day, the kitchen is spotless, well equipped and spacious enough to make the cooking process very easy. This place is definitely a great finding for us. We love OC off season, it's more relaxing and peaceful. Thanks to Chad for being very responsive and making our staying a perfect break for my family and friends. We will go back for sure.", "We were so pleasantly surprised!

We had an issue with the air when we first checked out, but they sent someone over right away without us having to ask, and solved the issue, so that was appreciated. To keep in mind for anyone booking though, the kitchen did not have a lot of cooking utensils/supplies (like pots and pans, there was no pepper, only one pot holder, etc).", "Great location, beautiful vacation home, friendly and helpful staff. Always responded quickly when we needed something. Awesome hospitality!!!", "Overall, the place itself was nice, but there are some easy fixes to make this place more comfortable for guests. First, the kitchen was stocked with the bare minimum. If you plan of cooking a lot, you may want to bring some of your own kitchen supplies. Second, plan to bring your own bath towels. The listing says linens are provided, so naturally, we didn\u2019t bring any\u2026 each adult was provided 1 full size bath towel, a small hand towel and a wash cloth. This might be okay for some, but like many women, I like to use 2 towels\u2026 when I reached out to the rental company requesting more towels, I was first asked how many towels were on the property - why does this matter!? They proceeded to tell me the rental was stocked for maximum capacity and they couldn\u2019t provide any extra towels. I\u2019m sorry, but 1 towel per person is not adequate. They also provide extra pillows, but no pillow cases to put them in. Lastly, if you\u2019re traveling with friends or family, you should know the main living space is above another rentals bedroom. We received a noise complaint from the neighbors at 6:30PM while we were in the middle of making dinner ON 4TH OF JULY. Not sure if the tenants below were full time residents, or if we just got unlucky with unreasonable neighbors, but definitely something to consider if you plan to talk to the people you\u2019re traveling with. In terms of cleanliness, it was mostly good. The master bath had black mold in the inside of toilet bowl, but other than that it was okay. The full size washer and dryer was great, and the rental was spacious. Easy walk to the beach. The rental company was basically useless, and we had to pay $40 for late check out even though they tell you it will be offered to you automatically if it\u2019s available. They ask if there\u2019s anything they can do to help make your stay more comfortable\u2026.

Plenty of parking. Washer and dryer was nice to have. Clean upon arrival. Guest services were quick to reply. It lists one bed as queen, the couple who slept in it say full. Be aware of the many steps-they are in the description, just take it into consideration if you have toddlers. <br/>Temperature setting is controlled and bedrooms on 2nd floor get very stuffy so temp comfort was an ongoing issue. The condo sleeps 10-unfortunately the living room area sits 3 adults comfortably-small couch and one chair-there are ottomans that can be used as seating but not too many adults are doing that for long. <br/>There were definite pluses and no one tried to hide anything, just a couple things to take note of if you have a large group.

Living room couches were dated and had some rips.  Balcony off living room had run down furniture.  Adirondack chair needs to be cleaned as is small table.  Carpets were 'sandy' throughout.  Vacuum didn't work and I don't think the cleaning crew vacuumed or cleaned thoroughly. House was not that clean upon arrival.  Bathrooms were missing drain stops throughout.  <br />\r\nKitchen: Keurig worked great as did the refrigerator.  Ice maker made ice but didn't dispense ice cubes. Seating was plentiful. Refrigerator/Stove hadn't been cleaned on the outside.  Didn't cook much.  Pots and Pans were very worn out.   Silverware was thrown in kitchen drawers arbitrarily. <br />\r\nBedrooms:   Bunk bed was broken.  Top Level Bedroom had only a tiny nightstand with drawer space.

Community has a pool which you have to sign up for time slots but always got in on the standby line. We crabbed off their pier and had a great time. The unit has 4 floors the furniture is older but adequate. Longer vehicles will have trouble parking as both garage and small driveway are not deep. The truck we had would not fit in the garage and the large SUV had less than 2\u201d clearance in the garage. Great location on the island short walk to the ocean and not far from busier downtown.

While you could tell it was not family owned the space was clean and adequate. \nBecause of COVID we tried reaching out several times to ask about the pool situation. We never got a response and only found out about the pool procedures the day we checked in. We were told you have to make reservations using the website. After that did not work we called the clubhouse only to find out they were booked for the week & people were calling ahead of their vacations to reserve spots. We were very disappointed especially for our kiddos who were looking forward to some pool time. \nOverall the community is really quaint, the little bay beaches were nice to have with little ones. And the sunsets are amazing. The walking path around the community is great for those that love to get a little outside exercise.

I\u2019m not sure of how they do their cleaning after every time the house is rented or how they keep a track of things that are broke. But there was quite a bit of things that was broken and unclean like the coffee maker, a door knob in the kitchen. There also was no key card for us to access the swimming pool. Rather we wanted to go or not it should have been there to give us options. The man that I spoke to about that situation was very nice and seem to care and try to find a way to get us what we need it. But being that they charge people for losing it.

The front storm door wouldn't close, after we used the storm door opener at the bottom (Pic enclosed) to keep the door opened. The screen door remained open as we were unable to free the lock button. Right off the bat when we arrived and began to bring in our stuff. \n\nThe HOT WATER (or lack of) was inconceivable as to how we were supposed to have hot water. Which for the most part, we didn't have. We read the instructions provided by the info email. The amount of water that was wasted in order to get the very limited hot water was despicable. To have to run water around others parts of the house to get the geothermal \"endless hot water\" was an absolute lie. \n\nWe never had enough hot water on any day for more than 4 showers. We wasted 100s of gallons of water to wait for the hot water to never arrive. The kids couldn't bathe. It was without a doubt completely unacceptable and I will be reporting it to the city of Ocean City to let them know we were advised to run water around the house, waste water in order to kick in the endless hot water that never materialized. What a joke. We were miserable!\n\nThe batteries for the Xfinity remote n the living room were dead. We had to switch the working batteries back and forth from the master bedroom remote to living room in order to change the channel. No spare batteries were located anywhere. \n\nThe Master bedroom 1st floor bed was horrible. You couldn't be in the bed and move with creaking the whole mattress and waking up your spouse. 2 nights of misery in that bed. Not enough pillow cases for the smallest and flattest pillows I've ever encountered. \n\nThe master 1st floor bathroom shower lever to turn from cold to hot (that never appeared) was hard to turn, I ended up breaking nail because it had no movement and finger caught because it didn't move. That was night one, we should have moved that night! \n\nI'm out of room to continue to list the issues, just pick a different house!", "Everything was okay. Clearness could have been way better.

There was a pile of dirty towels on the outside table. The floors were very gritty and there was old bread left behind the toaster. The smell of air freshener was so heavy. As the week progressed we realized the excessive air freshener was to cover the extreme mustiness throughout the unit. \nSince the SMALLEST bed in the house was in the MASTER bedroom (makes no sense), my husband and I chose the front room and gave the children the two back bedrooms. Big mistake. The bed in the front bedroom was the most uncomfortable thing we have ever slept on. It creeks and sags in the middle, leaving each of us clinging to the edges all night. We tried moving to the pull out couch for the last two nights and that was equally terrible. \nThe three bedrooms in general are shabby needing to be painted. The blinds in the front bedroom, facing the street, need to be replaced\nThe most egregious thing we found was the top bed cover in the \u201cmaster\u201d bedroom had white flaky stains - we immediately stripped all the beds of top covers and slept with a sheet only. They clearly were not laundered. \nAlso on the \u201cmaster\u201d bed, the fitted sheet and protector did not fit properly and came undone at the head side every night leaving my daughter on a partially bare mattress. After the blanket incident, this was concerning. \nThe couch in living room was sandy and really old, dirty and terribly uncomfortable - it needs to be replaced. Same with the outdoor couch which is equally old and uncomfortable. \nWe had no washcloths. There were no drinking glasses - the entire kitchen is poorly stocked. We never cooked inside due to the limited options and state of cleanliness. The dishwasher was STILL broken\u2026. which I had read about on a previous review, so we know it\u2019s been broken for a while. I didn\u2019t come on vacation to do dishes by hand. As a result, we went out to eat a lot and stayed inside as little as possible. \nOnly one remote control worked out of all 4 TV\u2019s. The air conditioners are old and loud and they don\u2019t regulate temperature well. \nI hate complaining but I couldn\u2019t let this go. This place needs a lot of help and attention for the price we paid.", "The location was great! Unit was clean and 3 bedrooms were a great size.

The deck was great and the unit had chairs, boogie boards and sand toys. The unit has a ton of potential, but there are some cosmetic things that need attention. The dishwasher not working was not that big of a deal, as we were only there for a few days. The doorknob on the double bedroom needed tightening, and the bathrooms needed a facelift with new mildew free shower curtains. The mattresses were not comfortable, and the bedding was worn. The floor was sandy upon our arrival, frustrating given how much we paid for a cleaning fee. The unit has window air conditioning units, which worked fine but were very loud. An addition of ceiling fans would help with airflow and cut down on the need for the A/C to constantly run. Check in and check out were easy, and cable tv was nice.

It was the perfect size, had 3 BRs, one which we used for the 2 kids. We spent most of our waking time at the property on the porch outside, where we had dinner every evening. The beach was a quick walk and no major road crossings, there were food options nearby (seafood, tacos, thai, sushi, pizza, etc), and most of the property kept cool when it was hot. The downsides are that this is right off of coastal Ave so it's fairly loud, the back left bedroom AC wasn't very strong, the floors and couches were very sandy when we arrived, there was a towel bar in the stand-alone bathroom that kept falling off, the dishwasher wasn't working, the one dedicated parking space was super tight to get in to, and the porch would get a lot of leaking when it rained.

Great place when you need quiet & peace.", "The neighborhood was even quieter than I anticipated, much to our delight. The balcony being by the water was incredible for morning coffee and a few drinks after dark. Everything worked, I\u2019ve not always had that experience in these types of lodging. If you want a two minute walk to the beach, this isn\u2019t for you. Although, we don\u2019t mind a drive being midwesterners. Overall, this was a pretty good place to stay.\n\nCarpet looked a little stained, but that can be a challenge in locales near a beach. That\u2019s about the only downside I could think of.", "My husband and I have traveled for the past 34 years ,several times to Ocean City ,MD and this by far is the dirtiest place we have stayed. When we arrived there was toothpaste in the sink, the carpet looked like it had not be vacuumed in months ,especially under the bed. When we called the owner he sent the cleaning lady of the next am 6/28 when we came back the carpet and floors were still not vacuumed. I spent the first hour of my arrival cleaning the bathroom & kitchen. \nThis place defiantly needs a upgrade and a good cleaning", "Great communication with owner and enjoyed our stay. \n\nWould stay again and recommend to others! Thank you!", "Very quiet location. Bed was a bit firm but acceptable.", "Craig\u2019s condo is not a bad place to stay as long as he provides enough details about it on his listing so as to manage renter\u2019s full expectations. I am a licensed property manager, landlord and interior designer by trade so just offering a thorough review. \n\n- This is an older building that has wall unit AC and base board heat, not central air. This type of AC does not do a good job at de-humidifying and some may construe this as damp. But this is normal for wall unit AC. \n\n-The carpet was fairly heavily soiled, but I was booking this after the summer high rental season, so it did not surprise me. I wore flip flops while inside because it is a bit off-putting. Carpets are not ideal for beach rentals as it is challenging to keep clean in between rentals.\n\n- There were no linens provided and I was not made aware of this before arriving. Please bring your own. The bed appears to be a Queen size. There is no mention of this in the listing yet, though I hope Craig makes that change.\n\n-This condo does not \u201chave bugs\u201d and is not bug infested. I saw one. This is a ground level condo and insects can arrive at any time in the real world even with a pest service contract in place.\n\n- I liked Craig\u2019s pictures and nick knacks above the kitchen cupboards. This is not a professionally decorated condo, so it has a personal homey feel. You sort of feel like you are crashing at Craig\u2019s beach crash pad. He leaves some personal items and some things in the fridge.\n\nSuggestions for Craig:\nCraig, please add to your listing the fact that you are not providing sheets or towels and note the bed size. Maybe mention you leave some personal items here and there or in the fridge so renters have that expectation, along with mentioning it\u2019s an older building with wall AC units. Also, explain that there is no need for a parking pass to go in your car after arriving so no one worries about that. \nPlease get the carpet professionally shampooed during the off-season, but beyond that, may I suggest you invest in LVP flooring throughout the unit. This is maintenance free flooring and easy to keep clean in between rentals. Believe me, your renters will be much happier. Thanks for the last minute stay.\n\n", "I just returned from this property. When I booked this condo there were no reviews available. Then the day before I was supposed to leave I saw some very sketchy reviews. I was pretty nervous but I took a chance and moved ahead. I'm glad that I did. To address the previous review the front of the building could use a power wash and yes, the carpet inside the condo definitely needs replacement. However, it was clean, everything worked as it should and there were no bugs (I looked). While not a new unit, it is actually nicer than the photos indicate. But the best part is the location. The view from the deck was lovely. I could sit there all day. Parking was easy. I did not use the pool so can't comment on that. I had no issue with owner communication. Overall it was a very nice stay.", "Upon arrival the exterior of the building is noticeably old and negelcted. For example, the side walks are covered in green mildew.\nUpon entrance into the unit, the hallway is narrow, smells musty and appears to have never been vaccumed.\nOnce inside the unit, there is an overwhelming ordor of mildew and dampness. The carpet appears to have expereinced significant water damage 10+ years ago and has never been replaced. The walls, baseboards and furniture are all covered and coated with dust and dirt.

The house was super clean, we could even smell it. We were very excited about this given it was our first overnight stay since COVID began. The house was stocked with everything we could need including a pack and play for the baby! One room was already set up for working from home complete with large screen TV for a second screen. I could sit down, plug in and work with no issues. It was a very short, straight walk to the beach. And the section of beach was nice a quiet. Easy drive to park nearer to the busier strip of boardwalk. If you're up for it the walk wasn't bad either! We will for sure be back!", "Our family of 4 enjoyed a weekend pandemic retreat to Rachel and Julio's Ocean City townhome. The location is bayside at the north end of the boardwalk, away from the shop/restaurant crowds. This was the perfect home base for all our OC adventures! \nAs someone who does rentals quite often, it was nice to have a keyless entry - no fear of losing a key on the beach! As you walk into the home, the garage to the left is a great transition space to get out of your sandy beach shoes and clothes. It was also a great place for the kids to play on a rainy day, and there were beach toys, and beach chairs in the storage closet which we used.\nUp one flight of stairs to the main living space, and you are greeted with a flood of sunlight from the windows and sliding glass door to the deck. The main floor has a huge L-shaped couch, large TV (movie night!), 8-seat dining room table and spacious open kitchen with 3 more breakfast bar seats. The kitchen is well-equipped, it includes a griddle, popcorn maker, tons of pots and pans, and even a toaster oven! We did lots of cooking and were able to store leftovers in the provided plastic storage containers. The deck off the living room has a nice set of chairs (4) to relax, admire the bay and enjoy your morning coffee. Our 6-year old and toddler loved the bean bag chair and sitting corner!\nOn the third floor are three bedrooms and two bathrooms. One room was converted to an office, equipped with ethernet cable and a large screen TV which could be plugged into your laptop with an HDMI cord. It makes for a great remote work location during the pandemic! We stayed in the spacious master bedroom, which has blackout shades and an en suite bathroom with a fully tiled standup shower. The blackout shades made the room pitch black, which meant my toddler slept in an extra hour...what parent doesn't love that!? I really appreciated that we were able to use their pack and play and noise machine, two less things to have to travel with! Our 6-year-old stayed in the room down the hall, which had a cute little tugboat toddler bed. The hall closet has extra blankets and pillows, and the bathroom has shampoo/conditioner and soap which is always super convenient.\nWe made day trips to the boardwalk (two-blocks away), walked the beach, hiked trails, and watched wild horses at Assateague Island (20 min drive), enjoyed a 28-inch wood-stove pizza from Ripieno's (on 33rd), and Dumsers Dairyland ice cream (Ocean Gateway). \nA PERFECT RETREAT!"], "ratings": [5, 5, 5, 5], "availability": "NNNNNNNNNNNNYNNNNYYNNNNNYYYYNNNY"},

Took us the first few hours of vacation to clean the place. One of the first things you will see is the gigantic rips in the couches, the one arm was completely ripped with foam sticking out, one cushion was completely ripped too. Then there was just a bunch of little rips everywhere. We covered them with sheets. The main balcony door was broke and wouldn\u2019t open. The door did get fixed the day before we left, but since we didn\u2019t know when they were coming we had to miss our boat ride with our family that we already paid for. The A/C barely worked, the main bedroom was around 90-95 degrees. We had it set on 72 but it never went below 79. The faucet in the kitchen was broken and was ridiculously hard to use. The washing machine was broken, it did not spin at all, so your clothes still had soap in them and were dripping wet. We had to go to the laundry mat to wash our stuff which is ridiculous since we paid the have these amenities. The plastic chair on the balcony was broken and before we knew it was my 4 year old sat on it and got pinched. The sliding Mirror closet Doors in the smaller room where my kids were staying were off the track and my 4 year old almost accidental knocked them over and if it would have hit him or his sister they would have been seriously injured. The refrigerator was leaking and not keeping stuff cold, after 2 days my step dad did fix this somewhat. If you like taking hot/warm showers don\u2019t stay here! The hot water didn\u2019t even last through one shower, they have a note saying to conserve hot water because they only have a 40 gallon tank but the temperature on the hot water tank has to be turned all the way down. We called when we arrived to let them know about the problems but only the balcony door got fixed while we were still there. I really hope the other problems were handled before the next guests arrived! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe aware you have to schedule 2 hours to use the pool a day. They only allow 11 people in the pool at a time. They have 3- 2 hour time slots each day they are 9am-11am, 12pm-2pm, and 3pm-5pm which ever time you would like to go you have to go down a half an hour or so before and wait to sign up and get a wristband, once the time slot fills that\u2019s it and you can only sign up for one time slot each day. The indoor pool, gym, and sauna are closed also. <br />\r\nIf you need an extra parking space it\u2019s $105 not $15.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the upside:<br />\r\nThe view was very beautiful, we got to see dolphins so many times! They were so close to shore, jumping and playing around. It was amazing to see. The tiki bar was awesome, the food was really good, a few nights they had entertainment. The pool deck was really nice, with the shops, cafe, ice cream store, arcade and the private beach. The kids loved hanging out and playing with other kids on the private beach! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI really had to complain and leave such a negative review but I just want to warn people who will be staying in this unit that these problems may still be there when they arrive. We never stay anywhere without a washing machine in the unit because we need it so having it not work was a huge inconvenience and I hate for someone to have a stressful vacation like we did!"], "ratings": [4, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1], "availability": "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNYYYNNNNNNNNNNN"},

Since most listing photos tend to make the space look better/bigger, we were so happy to walk into the space we were hoping for! The property was everything we needed and more! The super short walk to the beach was awesome since we have small kids. It was also clean!! Which really wins over a Momma like me! The only \"complaints\" we have is that the parking behind the property was supposed to be 2 spaces per unit. Apparently the owner keeps a vehicle there so both units dont actually get 2 spaces. And, we were bummed about the tiny charcoal grill especially when we saw the grill that the upstairs unit had! Other than that, we were beyond happy with our stay here and cannot wait to come back next year! We might even look into getting the top one at the same time for more family to join us. Thank you!", "Nice place and location. Communication was good with property management until the end when it came to the linens where is was not clear towels where a separate price. Also, there is literally no toilet paper, paper towels or kitchen cooking supplies when you get there FYI. Just salt and pepper.", "We enjoyed our stay here! Check in and checkout was easy and great location.

Close to the beach and bus stop the back yard was a nice extra bonus!", "This unit is well managed. There were a few glitches but the team was accessible and responsive. Vacation is what you make of it, and I enjoyed my stay.\n\nParking: The property advertises \u201cample private parking\u201d. Note that there are four private parking spots. Ideally, two per unit, which is ample and I could make due with 1. Unfortunately, July 4-8 there was a problem with the number of available private spaces. Private parking on 78th street is everything and during my visit this property fell short. \n\nThere are two units an upstairs unit B and a downstairs unit A. Because I have difficulty with stairs, I choose unit A. The property is exactly like stated in the description and the photos are accurate. Very nice. \n\nThere is a hose on the side rear of the property to rinse sand. \n\nThe kitchen is very well stocked with gadgets and nice appliances. The kitchen table comfortably seats six and they even have TV trays. The living room is spacious and well appointed. The furniture is decent for a beach house. Plenty of space. WI-FI is good, TV channel selection is great, several TV's in the unit, and the AC system works very well. \n\nTip: As another review mentioned, the unit was not thoroughly cleaned when I arrived, so bring cleaning supplies just in case. You will need your own towels, wash cloths, toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags, soaps, sheets, pillows, blankets etc. There was a smell of tobacco on arrival, that gradually lessened during the stay. \n\nBathrooms: The two bathrooms are very nice; if you have someone who has trouble with movement, note that the tubs are very high. The water pressure is good, and the tub is not slippery. There is a grab bar on the inner tub/shower door. \n\nNoise: Depending on who is above you, noise could be an issue. You will hear every movement.\n\nBeach: A short walk to the end of the street and over the dune. The beach is lovely. \n\nLocation: Excellent", "Property was clean and close to the beach! Perfect for our family vacation", "We enjoyed our family vacation at this beach house. Great location and a short walk to the beach. The kitchen looks brand new, love the open concept to the living room, beautiful hardwood floors and updated bathrooms.

Other than that we can\u2019t think of anything negative to say about this place!", "Had a really nice time. A rough start to the week but everything worked out fine.", "Our 4 generation family group enjoyed staying at this cozy home away from home. This unit allowed us to spend time as a family in the main area of the house, but then have private time in our bedrooms. The closeness to the beach was wonderful, giving us the ability for after dark walks along the beach. This home was also very close to St. Luke Catholic church, which enabled us to attend morning Mass at 9:00. A bonus for us was observing an Osprey nest atop a siren pole that can be seen from St. Luke's parking lot.

The AC unit in the third floor bedroom did not work correctly. It blew out hot air causing us to sleep with the fan and balcony door open. The umbrella for the balcony table did not securely fit so we had to tie it down. Besides those things the place was clean to the eye and was a lovely place. Although the check in was 4pm we did not get in until past that time because the cleaners had arrived super late.

It was nice to have the deck (you can bring a boat/jet skis right up to the back of the house), a crab pod to catch crabs and a propane grill (even though it was empty and had to get a replacement tank which we didn't expect to have to pay for) to grill out. The beds (full) were very uncomfortable, especially in the master bedroom. I felt like the legs under the bed were going to collapse at any moment. We kept having to fix the legs. The one downfall I believe to this property is that it lacked a thorough description of what is in the home that renters can utilize, such as 4 beach chairs, 4 beach boards, etc.\nThe living room couch/loveseat were dirty so we covered them with sheets. The kitchen is not fully stocked with crab items you would think would be there since you are at the beach and I have rented other places and found kitchens to be fully stocked, so bring your own kitchen items for eating crabs and grilling, especially a pot to cook the crabs. I think the property management just needs to update the description details of the property so when renting you know what is in the house and what you will need to bring. Overall, the house was nice, clean and comfortable for a family. Note, the first bedroom has 2 twin beds so if you have small children who dread going to bed while adults stay up, bring a noise machine because it's close to the living room.", "Property is exactly as photographed. Great location and was really quiet. Will use this place again without question.", "Such a nicely updated property! Lots of space inside and being on the canal off season was such a treat!", "This small home was cozy and comfortable, though you might stress to management to do a better job of cleaning the floors. It was renovated probably a year or so ago, so the bathrooms and kitchen are modern and bright. We didn't complain about the cleaning since we were there in October during the pandemic, were mostly stay-at-home except for walks to the beach, and so didn't want cleaning service to come in while we were there. The beach is about 8 blocks away, so too far to schlep beach chairs etc., but off season it's easy to park on the street across from the beach public access point between two tall hotels. I was disappointed we couldn't use the fireplace\u2014it should be noted in the description that it can't be used by guests. The grill was of great quality, and the kitchen was stocked well with decent pans and gadgets, for a rental. The coffee maker is a single-serve Keurig, so we bought a drip coffeepot and left it there. Though there are three good tvs, you need to be accustomed to using a smart tv in order to use the one in the living room effectively\u2014the only one hooked up to broadcast cable; the others are only smart-tv driven (you need to bring your account info to use Netflix, for example). Having two seating areas was great\u2014one for tv watchers, one for reading, and the furniture was all comfortable. Being on a waterway brought nature right up to the back deck, though the neighbors are all close by. Off season no one was there except across the waterway so it didn't matter so much. It rained a lot so we were indoors a lot, and the house was warm and cozy and yet spacious enough to accommodate five without going nuts. We were told to bring linens AND blankets and pillows, but there were good quilts and pillows in the closets.

There are mattress protectors and pads and pillow protectors to prevent this from happening. The twin bunkbeds also need somesort of support to make them safe. They were tied together with string. A simple piece of plywood would solve the issues with the lack of slats in them. Also if you are an adult and want to sleep in the bigger bunkroom bed it is the most uncomfortable bed. You can not move without horrible squeaking. As for the bathroom, the shower curtain needed replaced. There was mildew everywhere on it. The bath mats also seemed to not have been washed this year. All this said, we did alot of laundry our first night and replaced lightbulbs that we should not have had to do. These are things that the cleaning/management company should be taking care of. So would we stay here again??? No. We have had much better experiences at other rentals.\n\nOther suggestions\n-fix the front door (it took us 10 minutes two separate times to wiggle the door to get in.\n-fix the garage gate (its not gated if there is no gate)\n-2 elevator keys (very inconvenient with 2 families and only one key)\n-have pizza pans and baking pans\n-fix the mirror in the dining room or let your tenants know you know it is broke\n-have a light in the dining room\n-have check out sheet so tenants know expectations when leaving.\n\nAs a landlord, I like to know what can be improved. Hopefully this helps.", "This is a very good place for its location and peaceful view. My family and I really enjoyed it. Some of the areas for improvements are: 1) Fix the current screen for the door to the balcony. The current screen is broken. We can't use it for refresh air; otherwise flies came in and became very hard to deal with; 2) the door lock is very old and tricky to use. 3) the shower curtains are very old and hanging way too long and tricky to use; 4) Add a baking pan/sheet as we couldn't bake anything if we didn't bring our own baking sheet.", "Everything was great no worries", "Beautiful bay view from the balcony. Super close to the action on the boardwalk, but none of the craziness. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you for providing a wonderful home. \n\nThe only negative was not being told before arrival that the keypad on the door was broken. It took over ten minutes to figure out how to get into the place (not so much fun with two little kids after an 8 hour drive). No answer from management when we called which was disappointing. And was finally told about door after sending a message through VRBO.", "Just like the pictures l, this house is comfortable and in a great location. Short walk to the boardwalk with amusement park. Store a block away. And the beach is right there. Nice stay", "The location was great and was pretty spacious for our small group. Nobody from our group had any complaints. The boardwalk and amusement area was within walking distance. The cleanliness was acceptable. Would definitely stay here again.", "We come to OC every year. This is my favorite location yet! You have a beautiful Bay view (which you get in many complexes) but also the proximity to boardwalk without the craziness of boardwalk. We like to go to the Harbor Inn across the street as a tradition, so we lucked out! \nThe condo is clean, spacious, well furnished. Lots of reading material and homey-details. Easy check in & thorough directions. Thank you so much! Hope to stay again!"], "ratings": [4, 5, 5, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], "availability": "NNNNNNNNYYYYYYNNNNYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"},

If you don\u2019t like the temp resetting at 75 degrees I would suggest getting with them to have this fixed for you. \nAlso a guide to know how to use the TV would be helpful. There are 4 remotes! We eventually figured it out. \nOverall we enjoyed our stay!", "Hi, we will be checking out today. This has just been one issue after another and we haven\u2019t gotten to enjoy the space at all. The balcony was a huge selling point so not being able to get out to the balcony was a huge issue. Even though someone called to come fix it, I shouldn\u2019t have to be handling calls for a maintenance issue when I am on vacation. Additionally, the bedroom TV did work. Again, the listing promised A tv in the bedroom so that was very disappointing. Lastly, the AC didn\u2019t hold and my husband had to get up a few times in the middle of the night to turn it back down because we were absolutely sweating. This was a lot of money for us to take this small vacation and it seems like we had one maintenance issue after another. Regardless of if someone can come fix it, this is our time and space for three days, we don\u2019t need maintenance men in here or fielding calls to work out a time. We paid for the space, we expect it to be right. Cherry on top was that the listing stated the parking spot was in the garage, when it\u2019s very much so not. It\u2019s just time wasted and we are extremely disappointed. We can\u2019t take another night in the heat so we are cutting the trip short. We gave it one night thinking the air needed to adjust but after two nights of that and everything else we can\u2019t take it any more. Additionally there are signs everywhere about trash but no directions on where it goes. Yet another wild goose chase. The trash is all picked up in bags by the door. Some type of compensation is 1000% warranted. This was our trip for the summer and what we could afford and to have this experience is beyond disappointing.", "The view was amazing.", "I'll start off by saying the unit was clean, great location, facility was well kept. Woman at front office that takes care of checking you was LOVELY, FRIENDLY, AND A PLEASURE.\nWe paid a lot of money during prime season, I paid for a room that was on the 15th floor, with a balcony looking over the ocean. My choice, I wanted what I paid for.\nThe sliding door was broken and I could not open it. My BF who is a strong construction worker in NYC (steamfitter) had to use all his strength to slide the door open. Screen was completely ripped on the screen door so we could not even leave it open if we wanted to. When we called Vacaca, they were trying to get someone to fix the door, no one ever did. \nOperating the TV's and the range top was challenging and the kitchen truly lacked proper cooking utensils (I LOVE to cook breakfast when on vacation).\nI was more than willing to pay for the stay but we didn't get what was advertised. \nI had a beautiful time in the area, and I hate to complain, but think it's wise to share this experience so the management company or the owner takes some ownership for this. \nVacaca did give us a $200 credit (I had to negotiate this) which I feel was not enough for what we paid but I was just too angry to let this ruin my vacation. They offered a credit for another stay at another property but really didn't want to deal with them anymore after this experience.\nWe are staying at the Golden Sands again in August but booked with a different company, I hope this one is better.", "My husband and I split the week to have a few days to ourselves at the beach. <br />\r\nPros: <br />\r\nThe view!<br />\r\nThe bed is comfortable. <br />\r\nCons:<br />\r\nThere were stains on the mattress cover and pillows. I doubled up on the sheets. There wasn\u2019t an extra set of king size linens so none of the fitted sheets fit.<br />\r\nThe building is old. Around 10 pm the fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate the building from the 15th floor. Turns out it was the building\u2019s water pump. Subsequently they had to turn off the water to the building for an entire day. Luckily it was sunny out and I could spend the day at the beach. <br />\r\nThe couch is super uncomfortable and broken. Half of the couch doesn\u2019t sit up so I had to prop it up against the wall. There is no way anyone would sleep on that couch... unless they were drunk and passed out. <br />\r\nThe TV is extremely complicated. My husband had to call management and have someone come out and help him turn the cable on. Instructions would have been good.<br />\r\nThere is Netflix capability however the unit uses the building\u2019s internet which is too weak to support that function. <br />\r\nThe internet is weak. I had to have my phone on LTE to be able to watch cable and half the time it wasn\u2019t in HD.<br />\r\nA few days (with good weather) is fine. But a whole week without the advertised amenities would have been difficult. Also, a second couple using that couch as a bed would not have been an option.", "Really liked the property however we had issues with our TVs not working. \nWould stay there again if TVs worked.", "This is NOT your typical OC vacation stay. Beautiful renovation, comfortable bed and sleek.<br />\r\nNeeded a bit more cleaning..but, it was a great stay for a few days to clear my head.<br />", "Fantastic condo!
