# Web_Scraping_Projects

Thus repository contains two pairs of web scraping programs. One pair of scrapers scrape VRBO rental listings, including reviews, and the other pair of scrapers scrape Realtor home listings, including tax and price history. One VRBO webscraper solely uses Requests and the other VRBO webscraper is a Scrapy version of the same webscraper. Both Realtor web scraping programs use Scrapy, however, one utilizes SmartProxy proxies and the other utilizes Zyte proxies.
